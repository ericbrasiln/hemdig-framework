With the recent availability of public, large ground-truth datasets such as PubLayNet and DocBank, deep-learning models have proven to be very effective at layout detection and segmentation. While these datasets are of adequate size to train such models, they severely lack in layout variability since they are sourced from scientific article repositories such as PubMed and arXiv only. Consequently, the accuracy of the layout segmentation drops significantly when these models are applied on more challenging and diverse layouts. In this paper, we presentDocLayNet, a new, publicly available, document-layout annotation dataset in COCO format. It contains 80863 manually annotated pages from diverse data sources to represent a wide variability in layouts. For each PDF page, the layout annotations provide labelled bounding-boxes with a choice of 11 distinct classes. DocLayNet also provides a subset of double- and triple-annotated pages to determine the inter-annotator agreement. In multiple experiments, we provide baseline accuracy scores (in mAP) for a set of popular object detection models. We also demonstrate that these models fall approximately 10% behind the inter-annotator agreement. Furthermore, we provide evidence that DocLayNet is of sufficient size. Lastly, we compare models trained on PubLayNet, DocBank and DocLayNet, showing that layout predictions of the DocLayNet-trained models are more robust and thus the preferred choice for general-purpose document-layout analysis. © 2022 Owner/Author.","computer vision;

Deep learning based approaches for detecting the layout structure of document images have been promising. However, these methods require a large number of annotated examples during training, which are both expensive and time consuming to obtain. We describe here a synthetic document generator that automatically produces realistic documents with labels for spatial positions, extents and categories of the layout elements. The proposed generative process treats every physical component of a document as a random variable and models their intrinsic dependencies using a Bayesian Network graph. Our hierarchical formulation using stochastic templates allow parameter sharing between documents for retaining broad themes and yet the distributional characteristics produces visually unique samples, thereby capturing complex and diverse layouts. We empirically illustrate that a deep layout detection model trained purely on the synthetic documents can match the performance of a model that uses real documents. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian network; Layout analysis; Synthetic image generation","Deep learning; Image annotation; Stochastic systems; Bayesia n networks; Document images; Free layouts; Generative process; Layout analysis; Layout structure; Learning-based approach; Physical components; Spatial positions; Synthetic image generation; Bayesian networks",,,,,,"This paper was prepared for information purposes by the Artificial Intelligence Research group of JPMorgan Chase & Co and its affiliates (“JP Morgan”), and is not a product of the Research Department of JP Morgan.

Online newspapers are one such example which provide instant access to information anywhere and anytime on our mobiles, tablets, laptops, desktops, etc. But when it comes to searching for a specific advertisement in newspapers, online newspapers do not provide easy advertisement search options. Also, there are no specialized search portals which can provide for keyword-based advertisement search across multiple online newspapers. As a result, to find a specific advertisement in multiple newspapers, a sequential manual search is required across a range of online newspapers. Objective: This research paper proposes a keyword-based advertisement search framework to provide an instant access to the relevant advertisements from online English newspapers in a category of reader’s choice. Methods: First, an image extraction algorithm is proposed which can identify and extract the images from online newspapers without using any rules on advertisement placement and/or size. It is followed by a proposed deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model named ‘Adv_Recognizer’ which is used to separate the advertisement images from non-advertisement images. Another CNN Model, ‘Adv_Classifier’, is proposed, which classifies the advertisement images into four pre-defined categories. Finally, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technique is used to perform keyword-based advertisement searches in various categories across multiple newspapers. Results: The proposed image extraction algorithm can easily extract all types of well-bounded images from different online newspapers and this algorithm is used to create ‘English newspaper image dataset’ of 11,000 images, including advertisements and non-advertisements. The proposed ‘Adv_Recognizer’ model separates advertisement and non-advertisement images with an accuracy of around 97.8%. and the proposed ‘Adv_Classifier’ model classifies the advertisements in four predefined categories exhibiting an accuracy of around 73.5%. Conclusion: The proposed framework will help newspaper readers in performing exhaustive advertisement searches across a range of online English newspapers in a category of their own interest. It will also help in carrying out advertisement analysis and studies. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.","Advertisement image classification; convolutional neural networks (CNN); newspaper advertisements; newspaper layout segmentation; optical character recognition (OCR); residual networks (ResNet); transfer learning","Convolution; Deep learning; Extraction; Image classification; Image segmentation; Neural network models; Newsprint; Optical character recognition; Transfer learning; Advertisement image classification; Convolutional neural network; Images classification; Newspaper advertisements; Newspaper layout segmentation; Online newspaper; Optical character recognition; Residual network; Transfer learning; Convolutional neural networks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cover, T., Hart, P., Nearest neighbor pattern classification (1967) IEEE Trans.

The information in documents is typically in natural language, but can be organized in various layouts and formats. There have been recent spurt of interest in understanding document content with novel deep learning architectures. However, document understanding tasks need dense information annotations, which are costly to scale and generalize. Several active learning techniques have been proposed to reduce the overall budget of annotation while maintaining the performance of the underlying deep learning model. In this paper, we propose OPAD, a novel framework using reinforcement policy for active learning in content detection tasks for documents. The proposed framework learns the acquisition function to decide the samples to be selected while optimizing performance metrics that the tasks typically have. Furthermore, we extend to weak labelling scenarios to further reduce the cost of annotation significantly. We propose novel rewards to account for class imbalance and user feedback in the annotation interface, to improve the active learning method. We show superior performance of the proposed OPAD framework for active learning for various tasks related to document understanding like layout parsing, object detection and named entity recognition. Ablation studies for human feedback and class imbalance rewards are presented, along with a comparison of annotation times for different approaches. © 2022 IEEE.",,"Budget control; Deep learning; Learning systems; Purchasing; Active Learning; Business systems; Class imbalance; Content analysis; Document contents; Document understanding; Learning frameworks; Optimized policies; Performance; Policy-based; Object detection",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adhikari, A., Ram, A., Tang, R., Lin, J., (2019) Docbert: Bert for document classification, , 2; Aggarwal, C.C., Kong, X., Gu, Q., Han, J., Yu, P.S., (2014) Active learning: A survey, pp. 571-605. , 2, CRC Press, Jan; Aghdam, H.H., Gonzalez-Garcia, A., Lopez, A., Weijer, J., Active learning for deep detection neural networks (2019) 2019 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), , Oct, 3; Audebert, N., Herold, C., Slimani, K., Vidal, C., Multimodal deep networks for text and imagebased document classification (2019) Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, pp. 427-443. , Springer, 2; Binmakhashen, G.M., Mahmoud, S.A., Document layout analysis: A comprehensive survey (2019) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 52 (6), pp. 1-36. , 2; Bouguelia, M., Beläid, Y., Beläid, A., A stream-based semi-supervised active learning approach for document classification (2013) 2013 12th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pp. 611-615. , IEEE, 3; Brust, C., Käding, C., Denzler, J., Active learning for deep object detection (2019) Proceedings of the 14th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications, , 2, 3, 7; Brust, C., Käding, C., Denzler, J., Active and incremental learning with weak supervision (2020) KI-Künstliche Intelligenz, 34 (2), pp. 165-180. , Jan, 2; Casanova, A., Pinheiro, P.O., Rostamzadeh, N., Pal, C.J., Reinforced active learning for image segmentation (2020) International Conference on Learning Representations, , 2, 3, 4; Choudhary, S., Guttikonda, H., Roy Chowdhury, D., Learmonth, G.P., Document retrieval using deep learning (2020) 2020 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (SIEDS), pp. 1-6. , IEEE, 2; Vikas Desai, S., Chandra Lagandula, A., Guo, W., Ninomiya, S., Balasubramanian, V.N., An adaptive supervision framework for active learning in object detection (2019) BMVC, , 2; Devlin, J., Chang, M., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding (2019) Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, 1, pp. 4171-4186. , (Long and Short Papers) Minneapolis, Minnesota, June.

Document Layout Analysis is the first step of the automatic capturing of information from documents. The layout recognition supports establishing relationships between components in the document, which allows extraction of information. A method to visually segment critical regions of Historical handwritten documents using an object detection technique augmented with contextual features are presented in this paper. Layout analysis of Historical documents is complicated due to complex document layout and degradation of documents due to age. The object-detection technique YOLOv3 has been adopted for document layout analysis by extracting the features at different levels by down-sampling the input and combining it using Feature Pyramid Network to detect smaller regions to improve the region detection performance. The experimental results on two distinct datasets that demonstrate the method’s potential and competitive results with respect to state-of-the-art approaches have been presented. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Deep learning; Document layout analysis; Object detection",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Binmakhashen, G.M., Mahmoud, S.A., Document layout analysis: A comprehensive survey.

Our approach elevates the understanding of road layouts from pixel level to the level of graphs. To achieve this goal, an image-graph-image auto-encoder is utilized. The network is designed to learn to regress the graph representation at its auto-encoder bottleneck. This learning is self-supervised by an image reconstruction loss, without needing any external manual annotations. We create a synthetic dataset containing common road layout patterns and use it for training of the auto-encoder in addition to the real-world Argoverse dataset. By using this additional synthetic dataset, which conceptually captures human knowledge of road layouts and makes this available to the network for training, we are able to stabilize and further improve the performance of topological road layout understanding on the real-world Argoverse dataset. The evaluation shows that our approach exhibits comparable performance to a strong fully-supervised baseline. © 2022 IEEE.",,"Computer vision; Encoding (symbols); Roads and streets; Signal encoding; Topology; Auto encoders; Bird's eye view; Encodings; Neural-networks; Performance; Pixel level; Real-world; Road layouts; Scene understanding; Synthetic datasets; Image reconstruction",,,,,"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","This work was supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) in the context of the i-CAVE project.",,,,,,,,,,"Yang, W., Li, Q., Liu, W., Yu, Y., Ma, Y., He, S., Pan, J., Projecting Your View Attentively: Monocular Road Scene Layout Estimation via Cross-View Transformation (2021) Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 15536-15545; Shelhamer, E., Long, J., Darrell, T., Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation (2017) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 39 (4), pp. 640-651; He, K., Gkioxari, G., Dollar, P., Girshick, R., Mask R-CNN (2017) 2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 2980-2988; Johnson, J., Krishna, R., Stark, M., Li, L.-J., Shamma, D.A., Bernstein, M.S., Fei-Fei, L., Image retrieval using scene graphs (2015) 2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3668-3678; Lu, C., Vande Molengraft, M.J.G., Dubbelman, G., Monocular Semantic Occupancy Grid Mapping with Convolutional Variational Encoder-Decoder Networks (2019) IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 4 (2), pp. 445-452; Mani, K., Daga, S., Garg, S., Shankar, N.S., Krishna Murthy, J., Krishna, K.M., MonoLayout: Amodal scene layout from a single image (2020) 2020 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), pp. 1678-1686; Haklay, M., Weber, P., OpenStreetMap: User-Generated Street Maps (2008) IEEE Pervasive Computing, 7 (4), pp. 12-18; Xu, D., Zhu, Y., Choy, C.B., Fei-Fei, L., Scene Graph Generation by Iterative Message Passing (2017) 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3097-3106; Herzig, R., Raboh, M., Chechik, G., Berant, J., Globerson, A., Mapping Images to Scene Graphs with Permutation-Invariant Structured Prediction (2018) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 7211-7221; Zellers, R., Yatskar, M., Thomson, S., Choi, Y., Neural Motifs: Scene Graph Parsing with Global Context (2018) 2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5831-5840; Suhail, M., Mittal, A., Siddiquie, B., Broaddus, C., Eledath, J., Medioni, G., Sigal, L., Energy-Based Learning for Scene Graph Generation (2021) 2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 13931-13940; Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Fei-Fei, L., Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations (2017) International Journal of Computer Vision, 123 (1), pp. 32-73; Lu, C., Dubbelman, G., (2020) Image-Graph-Image Translation Via Auto-Encoding, , arXiv preprint, arXiv: 2012.05975; Chang, M.-F., Ramanan, D., Hays, J., Lambert, J., Sangkloy, P., Singh, J., Bak, S., Lucey, S., Argoverse: 3D Tracking and Forecasting with Rich Maps (2019) 2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 8740-8749; Lu, C., Dubbelman, G., (2022) Link to Code and Data, , https://github.com/tue-mps/road-as-graph; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, F.

However, the accessibility of STEM subjects for Blind and Visually Impaired (BVIP) students is a primary concern, especially in developing countries such as India. BVIP uses assistive technologies (ATs) like optical character recognition (OCR) and screen readers for reading/writing purposes. While parsing, such ATs skip NTCs and mainly rely on alternative texts to describe these visualization components. Integration of effective and automated document layout parsing frameworks for extracting data from non-textual components of digital documents are required with existing ATs for making these NTCs accessible. Although, the primary concern is the absence of an adequately annotated textbook dataset on which layout recognition and other vision-based frameworks can be trained. To improve the accessibility and automated parsing of such books, we introduce a new NCERT5K-IITRPR dataset of National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) school books. Twenty-three annotated books covering more than 5000 pages from the eighth to twelve standards have been considered. The NCERT label objects are structurally different from the existing document layout analysis (DLA) dataset objects and contain diverse label categories. We benchmark the NCERT5K-IITRPR dataset with multiple object detection methods. A systematic analysis of detectors shows the label complexity and fine-tuning necessity of the NCERT5K-IITRPR dataset. We hope that our dataset helps in improving the accessibility of NCERT Books for BVIP students. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Assistive reading; Document layout analysis; Graphical object detection; NCERT books; NCERT dataset","Developing countries; Object detection; Optical character recognition; Assistive; Assistive reading; Blind and visually impaired; Document layout analysis; Educational research; Graphical object detection; National council of educational research and training book; National council of educational research and training dataset; Training dataset; Object recognition",,,,,,"This research is supported by the DST under CSRI grant DST/CSRI/2018/234.",,,,,,,,,,"Vignesh, D., Gupta, N., Kalaivani, M., Goswami, A.K., Nongkynrih, B., Gupta, S.K., Prevalence of visual impairment and its association with vision-related quality of life among elderly persons in a resettlement colony of Delhi (2019) J.

It is costly to obtain the ground truth 3D layout, and this issue severely restricts the learning based 3D layout estimation approaches. In this paper, we present a novel weakly supervised learning framework that is able to learn the 3D layout effectively with 2D layout segmentation mask as supervision. We employ a deep neural network to predict the plane parameters and camera intrinsic parameters in the image. Based on the predicted plane instances, the 3D layout as well as the corresponding depth map and 2D segmentation can be generated. The key objectives for learning meaningful plane parameters are the label consistency of layout segmentation and depth consistency of border pixels from adjacent planes, with which the ground truth 2D layout segmentation is able to supervise the learning of the 3D layout. We further incorporate 3D geometric reasoning and prior knowledge in the learning process to ensure that the learned 3D layout is realistic and reasonable. Experimental results show that our method can produce accurate 3D layout estimates by weakly supervised learning. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","3D layout estimation; monocular stereo vision; plane parameters; weakly supervised learning","Computer vision; Deep neural networks; Image segmentation; Parameter estimation; Stereo image processing; Stereo vision; Supervised learning; Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional displays; 2D segmentation; 3d layout estimation; 3D layouts; Cognition; Layout; Monocular stereo vision; Plane parameter; Solid modelling; Three-dimensional display; Weakly supervised learning; Cameras",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Martin-Brualla, R., He, Y., Russell, B.C., Seitz, S.M., The 3D jigsaw puzzle: Mapping large indoor spaces (2014) Proc.

Unfortunately, publicly available Arabic datasets are limited in size and restricted to certain document domains. This paper presents the release of BE-Arabic-9K, a dataset of more than 9000 high-quality scanned images from over 700 Arabic books. Among these, 1500 images have been manually segmented into regions and labeled by their functionality. BE-Arabic-9K includes book pages with a wide variety of complex layouts and page contents, making it suitable for various document layout analysis and text recognition research tasks. The paper also presents a page layout segmentation and text extraction baseline model based on fine-tuned Faster R-CNN structure (FFRA). This baseline model yields cross-validation results with an average accuracy of 99.4% and F1 score of 99.1% for text versus non-text block classification on 1500 annotated images of BE-Arabic-9K. These results are remarkably better than those of the state-of-the-art Arabic book page segmentation system ECDP. FFRA also outperforms three other prior systems when tested on a competition benchmark dataset, making it an outstanding baseline model to challenge. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"Character recognition; Convolutional neural networks; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Benchmark datasets; Cross validation; Document layout analysis; NAtural language processing; Page segmentation; State of the art; Text block classification; Text recognition; Large dataset",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1838193; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT; Boston University, BU; Harvard University","The authors would like to thank the library staff at the Mugar Library at Boston University, the Rotch Library at MIT, and the Widener and Fine Arts libraries at Harvard University for facilitating the collection process of our dataset BE-Arabic-9K.

Moreover, we merge the outputs of the two branches to enhance the feature representation so as to further improve segmentation accuracy.

Methods: To solve the difficulty of identifying the spatial layout of drawings caused by various irregular drawing elements, a high⁃performance fusion recognition method combining raster image and vector representation is proposed. First, the rasterized representation of architectural plan drawings is used to extract the main development direction, and several enclosed spaces are constructed. Then, the vectorized representation of architectural plan drawings is used and according to the directional and adjacency characteristics of space recognition, the half⁃wall structure is innovatively proposed to calculate geometric position and topological relationship. The wall layout can be rebuilt as a whole with high precision according to the principle of space duality. Finally, the proposed method and the traditional methods are analyzed on the vector building plan data set of various wall layouts. Results: The experimental results show that the proposed fusion dual recognition algorithm is usable and effective for various types of building models. Conclusions: It has higher robustness and is less interfered by specific architectural drawing types. © 2021, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

The reason being the complexity of the layout and the highly variant typography. Nonetheless, in recent years, with the rise of Deep learning, significant progress has been made in historical OCR; in both layout recognition and segmentation, and also in character recognition. The only downside is the limited advancements dedicated to the Arabic language, notably the handwritten text. In this paper, we present an OCR approach that utilizes state-of-theart Deep learning techniques for the Arabic language. We built a custom dataset of obfuscated and noisy images to imitate the noise in historical Arabic documents, with a collection of 30 million images paired with their ground truth. The model utilizes both page segmentation and line segmentation techniques to enhance the resultant transcription. The model is complex enough for transcribing handwritten manuscripts. In addition, the model can detect and transcribe documents that contain Arabic diacritics. The model attained a CER of 0.0727, a WER of 0.0829, and a SER of 0.10. © 2021 IEEE.","handwritten text; OCR; Segmentation","Deep learning; Optical character recognition; Arabic languages; Hand-written text recognition; Handwritten texts; Historical documents; Learning techniques; Line segmentation; Optical character recognition (OCR); Page segmentation; Ubiquitous computing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahmad, I., Mahmoud, S.A., Fink, G.A., Open-vocabulary recognition of machine-printed Arabic text using hidden markov models (2016) Pattern Recognition, 51, pp. 97-111; Bluche, T., Louradour, J., Messina, R., Scan, attend and read: End-to-end handwritten paragraph recognition with mdlstm attention (2017) 2017 14th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 1, p. 10501055; Devlin, J., Chang, M., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., (2018) Bert: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding; Elleuch, M., Tagougui, N., Kherallah, M., Optimization of dbn using regularization methods applied for recognizing Arabic handwritten script (2017) Procedia Computer Science, 108, pp. 2292-2297; Goodfellow, I., Bengio, Y., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., (2016) Deep Learning, 1. , MIT press Cambridge; Graves, A., (2013) Generating Sequences with Recurrent Neural Networks; Graves, A., Fernandez, S., Gomez, F., Schmidhuber, J., Connectionist temporal classification: Labelling unsegmented sequence data with recurrent neural networks (2006) Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 369-376; Gruuening, T., Leifert, G., Strauss, T., Labahn, R., A robust and binarization-free approach for text line detection in historical documents (2017) 2017 14th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 1, p. 236241; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Deep residual learning for image recognition (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 770-778; Hochreiter, S., Schmidhuber, J., Long short-term memory (1997) Neural Computation, 9 (8), pp. 1735-1780; Huang, Z., Xu, W., Yu, K., (2015) Bidirectional Lstm-crf Models for Sequence Tagging; Kahle, P., Colutto, S., Hackl, G., Mühlberger, G., Transkribus-a service platform for transcription, recognition and retrieval of historical documents (2017) 2017 14th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 4, pp. 19-24; Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., (2014) Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization; Lawgali, A., Angelova, M., Bouridane, A., Hacdb: Handwritten Arabic characters database for automatic character recognition (2013) European Workshop on Visual Information Processing (EUVIP), pp. 255-259; Mahmoud, S.A., Ahmad, I., Al-Khatib, W.G., Alshayeb, M., Tanvir Parvez, M., Margner, V., Fink, G.A., Khatt: An open Arabic offline handwritten text database (2014) Pattern Recognition, 47 (3), pp. 1096-1112; Mahmoud, S.A., Ahmad, I., Alshayeb, M., Al-Khatib, W.G., Tanvir Parvez, M., Fink, G.A., Margner, V., El Abed, H., Khatt: Arabic offline handwritten text database (2012) 2012 International Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition, pp. 449-454; Müller, R., Kornblith, S., Hinton, G., (2019) When Does Label Smoothing Help?; Neudecker, C., Baierer, K., Federbusch, M., Boenig, M., Würzner, K., Hartmann, V., Herrmann, E., Ocr-d: An end-to-end open source ocr framework for historical printed documents (2019) Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Digital Access to Textual Cultural Heritage, pp. 53-58; Pechwitz, M., Snoussi Maddouri, S., Margner, V., Ellouze, N., Amiri, H., Ifn/enit-database of handwritten Arabic words (2002) Proc.

Processing these typed and handwritten forms poses challenges for document management in renaturation projects. We highlight the structural problems of drilling reports and present three approaches for recognizing and processing the information documented in them. We use optical character recognition and document layout analysis techniques to approach the problem. Layout analysis was performed using a heuristic approach and a neural network for layout recognition. In detail, we show the approaches Form Processing (A), Table detection by line counting (B) and processing with Mask-R-CNN (C). A case study is used to show initial results and challenges. B and C are more robust than A to small changes in the form. C can recognize columns better with more training data than B in cases where table boundaries are not respected. B and C also allow other language models to be used for OCR and can thus also recognize handwriting with appropriate training data. © 2021 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

Specifically, the task of room layout estimation is to segment an indoor RGB image with semantic surface labels, i.e., ceiling, floor, and walls. A straightforward solution for the problem is to estimate the geometry of the dominant indoor planes. However, since the ground truth depth maps of the layout is not easy to obtain, research in this direction is rare. In this paper, we focus on the cuboid rooms and propose an effective learning framework that can learn the depth maps of planes from 2D layout labels without ground truth depth maps. We employ a deep network to learn the surface parameters, which can be used to produce depth maps of planes and layout results. Then we propose stereo supervision mechanism that encourages the generated layout to be consistent with the ground truth layout segmentation along Z axis and layout edge on the image plane simultaneously, so that the learned surface parameters and layout results are reasonable. Experimental results show that our method can produce high-quality layout estimates and corresponding depth maps on benchmark datasets. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Benchmarking; Computer vision; Semantic Segmentation; Stereo image processing; Depthmap; Effective learning; Ground truth; High quality; Image plane; Learn+; Learning frameworks; RGB images; Supervision mechanisms; Surface parameter; Semantics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Martin-Brualla, R., He, Y., Russell, B.C., Seitz, S.M., The 3d jigsaw puzzle: Mapping large indoor spaces (2014) European Conference on Computer Vision.

Our core contribution is to extend existing detectors to exploit a learned structural prior for UI designs, enabling robust detection of UI components; buttons, text boxes and similar. Specifically we learn a prior over mobile UI layouts, encoding common spatial co-occurrence relationships between different UI components. Conditioning region proposals using this prior leads to performance gains on UI layout parsing for both hand-drawn UIs and app screenshots, which we demonstrate within the context an interactive application for rapidly acquiring digital prototypes of user experience (UX) designs. © 2021 IEEE",,"Digital devices; Drawing (graphics); Palmprint recognition; Co-occurrence relationships; Component detection; Hand-drawn sketches; Learn+; Mobile user interface; Robust detection; Screenshots; User interface components; User interface designs; User interface layouts; User interfaces",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alexe, B., Deselaers, T., Ferrari, V., Measuring the objectness of image windows (2012) IEEE Trans.

It is the vital step to support high-quality information extraction, table understanding and knowledge base construction over the documents from various vertical domains (e.g. financial, legal, and government fields). Here, we consider digital documents, where characters and graphic elements are given with their exact texts, positions inside document pages, compared with image documents. Towards document layout recognition with pinpoint accuracy, we consider this problem as a document panoptic segmentation task, that each token in the document page must be assigned a class label and an instance id. Considering that two predicted objects may intersect under traditional visual panoptic segmentation method, like Mask R-CNN, however, document objects never intersect because most document pages follow manhattan layout. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, named document panoptic segmentation (DPS) model. It first splits the document page into column regions and groups tokens into line regions, then extracts the textual and visual features, and finally assigns class label and instance id to each line region. Additionally, we propose a novel metric based on the intersection over union (IoU) between the tokens contained in predicted and the ground-truth object, which is more suitable than metric based on the area IoU between predicted and the ground-truth bounding box. Finally, the empirical experiments based on PubLayNet, ArXiv and Financial datasets show that the proposed DPS model obtains 0.8833, 0.9205 and 0.8530 mAP scores on three datasets. The proposed model obtains great improvement on mAP score compared with Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN models. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Knowledge based systems; Object detection; Class labels; Digital Documents; Document layouts; Ground truth; High quality; Knowledge-base construction; Object region; Physical objects; Segmentation models; Table understanding; Character recognition",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 62076231, U1811461; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2017YFB1002104","Acknowledgements.

While useful, the aggregation is a trade-off between instance-level analysis of predictions which may shed better light on a particular approach’s biases and performance characteristics. To enable a systematic understanding of instance-level predictions, we introduce DocVisor - a web-based multi-purpose visualization tool for analyzing the data and predictions related to various document image understanding problems. DocVisor provides support for visualizing data sorted using custom-specified performance metrics and display styles. It also supports the visualization of intermediate outputs (e.g., attention maps, coarse predictions) of the processing pipelines. This paper describes the appealing features of DocVisor and showcases its multi-purpose nature and general utility. We illustrate DocVisor’s functionality for four popular document understanding tasks – document region layout segmentation, tabular data detection, weakly-supervised document region segmentation and optical character recognition. DocVisor is available as a documented public repository for use by the community. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Computer vision; Data visualization; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Visualization; Websites; Aggregate performance; Character error rates; Document images; Document layouts; Document-based; Multi-purpose; Performance; Performance measure; Visualizers; Web based; Optical character recognition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alberti, M., Bouillon, M., Ingold, R., Liwicki, M., Open evaluation tool for layout analysis of document images (2017) 2017 14Th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 4, pp. 43-47. , vol., pp., IEEE; Bukhari, S.S., Kadi, A., Jouneh, M.A., Mir, F.M., Dengel, A., AnyOCR: An open-source OCR system for historical archives (2017) 2017 14Th IAPR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 1, pp. 305-310. , vol., pp., IEEE; Cheriet, M., Kharma, N., Liu, C.L., Suen, C., (2007) Character Recognition Systems: A Guide for Students and Practitioners, , John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken; Clausner, C., Pletschacher, S., Antonacopoulos, A., Aletheia-An advanced document layout and text ground-truthing system for production environments (2011) 2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pp. 48-52. , pp., IEEE; Dwivedi, A., Saluja, R., Kiran Sarvadevabhatla, R., An OCR for classical indic documents containing arbitrarily long words (2020) The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, June; Everingham, M., van Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., Zisserman, A., The PASCAL visual object classes (VOC) challenge (2010) Int.

Advances in natural language processing have been driving the fast development in automated information extraction from scientific literature. However, scientific literature is often available in unstructured PDF format. While PDF is great for preserving basic visual elements, such as characters, lines, shapes, etc., on a canvas for presentation to humans, automatic processing of the PDF format by machines presents many challenges. With over 2.5 trillion PDF documents in existence, these issues are prevalent in many other important application domains as well. A critical challenge for automated information extraction from scientific literature is that documents often contain content that is not in natural language, such as figures and tables. Nevertheless, such content usually illustrates key results, messages, or summarizations of the research. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of scientific literature, the automated system must be able to recognize the layout of the documents and parse the non-natural-language content into a machine readable format. Our ICDAR 2021 Scientific Literature Parsing Competition (ICDAR2021-SLP) aims to drive the advances specifically in document understanding. ICDAR2021-SLP leverages the PubLayNet and PubTabNet datasets, which provide hundreds of thousands of training and evaluation examples. In Task A, Document Layout Recognition, submissions with the highest performance combine object detection and specialised solutions for the different categories. In Task B, Table Recognition, top submissions rely on methods to identify table components and post-processing methods to generate the table structure and content. Results from both tasks show an impressive performance and opens the possibility for high performance practical applications. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Document layout understanding; ICDAR competition; Table recognition","Cutting; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Object detection; Cutting edge innovation; Diverse domains; Document layout understanding; Document layouts; ICDAR competition; Natural languages; PDF format; Performance; Scientific literature; Table recognition; Automation",,,,,"U.S. National Library of Medicine, NLM","We would like to thank Sundar Saranathan for his help with the competition system.

Despite advances, standard deep network based approaches for semantic layout segmentation are not robust to complex deformations seen across semantic regions. This phenomenon is especially pronounced for the low-resource Indic palm-leaf manuscript domain. To address the issue, we first introduce Indiscapes2, a new large-scale diverse dataset of Indic manuscripts with semantic layout annotations. Indiscapes2 contains documents from four different historical collections and is 150 % larger than its predecessor, Indiscapes. We also propose a novel deep network Palmira for robust, deformation-aware instance segmentation of regions in handwritten manuscripts. We also report Hausdorff distance and its variants as a boundary-aware performance measure. Our experiments demonstrate that Palmira provides robust layouts, outperforms strong baseline approaches and ablative variants. We also include qualitative results on Arabic, South-East Asian and Hebrew historical manuscripts to showcase the generalization capability of Palmira. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Dataset; Deformable convolutional network; Document image segmentation; Historical document analysis; Instance segmentation","Computer vision; Deformation; History; Image segmentation; Large dataset; Semantics; Complex deformation; Convolutional networks; Dataset; Deformable convolutional network; Document image segmentation; Documents analysis; Handwritten document; Historical document analyse; Historical documents; Network-based approach; Instance Segmentation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, M., Mondal, A., Jawahar, C., (2020) Cdec-Net: Composite Deformable Cascade Network for Table Detection in Document Images, , ICPR; Alaasam, R., Kurar, B., El-Sana, J., Layout analysis on challenging historical arabic manuscripts using siamese network (2019) 2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pp. 738-742. , pp., IEEE; Alberti, M., Vögtlin, L., Pondenkandath, V., Seuret, M., Ingold, R., Liwicki, M., Labeling, cutting, grouping: An efficient text line segmentation method for medieval manuscripts (2019) 2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pp. 1200-1206. , pp., IEEE; Barman, R., Ehrmann, M., Clematide, S., Oliveira, S.A., Kaplan, F., (2020) Combining Visual and Textual Features for Semantic Segmentation of Historical Newspapers.

Combined with computer aided design (CAD), the virtual three-dimensional (3D) modeling system of scenic spots is designed, and VR real scene visit interactive tourism products suitable for different scenic spots are designed. 360° VR panoramic display technology is used for 360° VR panoramic video shooting and visiting system display production of Elephant Trunk Hill park scenery. A total of 157 images are collected and 720 cloud panoramic interactive H5 tool is selected to produce a display system suitable for 360° VR panoramic display of scenic spots. Meanwhile, based on single view RGB-D image, the latest convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm and point cloud processing algorithm are used to design the indoor 3D scene reconstruction algorithm based on semantic understanding. Experiments show that the pixel accuracy and mean intersection over union of the indoor scene layout segmentation network segmentation results are 89.5% and 60.9%, respectively, that is, it has high accuracy. The VR real scene visit interactive tourism product can make tourists have a more immersive sense of interaction and experience before, during and after the tour. © 2020 Deng et al.

It would be significant to construct an intelligent CAD system allowing automatic architectural layout parsing (AutoALP), which generates candidate designs or predicts architectural attributes without much user intervention. To tackle these problems, many learning-based methods were proposed, and benchmark dataset become one of the essential elements for the data-driven AutoALP. This paper proposes a new dataset called SCUT-AutoALP for multi-paradigm applications. It contains two subsets: 1) Subset-I is for floor plan design containing 300 residential floor plan images with layout, boundary and attribute labels; 2) Subset-II is for urban plan design containing 302 campus plan images with layout, boundary and attribute labels. We analyzed the samples and labels statistically, and evaluated SCUT-AutoALP for different layout parsing tasks of floor plan/urban plan based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) models. The results verify the effectiveness and indicate the potential applications of SCUT-AutoALP.

We report on issues related to building the corpus from the Austrian Alpine Club Journal (1869–2010). First, a general description of our data and the project phases from digitization and annotation to publication is given. We focus on the most interesting challenges that the diverse layouts and the extensive use of Fraktur typefacing posed for optical layout recognition and optical character recognition (OCR) as well as post correction. The corrected data was lemmatized and annotated with part-of-speech information including named entities as well as TEI-conformant metadata. The resulting 19.9-million-word corpus is designed to be queried using CQPweb and Hyperbase and can be accessed freely online. Lastly, we give a short roadmap of current and future expansions and improvements as corpus data has been and is being enhanced in follow-up projects. © John Benjamins Publishing Company","Alpinism; Document structure recognition; German Fraktur typeface; OCR; Specialized corpora",,,,,,"Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, ÖAW","Research funded by Austrian Academy of Sciences to Claudia Posch.",,,,,,,,,,"Achrainer, M., Das Historische Alpenarchiv der Alpenvereine (2014) Arbido – Fachzeitschrift Für Archiv, Bibliothek Und Dokumentation, 1, pp. 14-17; Baker, P., McEnery, T., (2015) Corpora and Discourse Studies: Integrating Discourse and Corpora, , https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137431738, Palgrave Macmillan; Beck, F., Schwabacher Judenlettern“: Schriftverruf im Dritten Reich [“Schwabach Jewish Typeface”: The discrediting of a typeface in the Third Reich (2006) Die Kunst Des Vernetzens: Festschrift Für Wolfgang Hempel [The Art of Networking: Festschrift for Wolfgang Hempel], pp. 251-269. , „ B.

In a chip, the memory accounts for more than half of the total area, making it important to improve the reliability of the processor by hardening the memory. Therefore, a dual modular redundancy hamming (DMRH) code is designed and proposed in this paper, which can mitigate one-bit and two-bit upset in memory. First, logic optimization was carried out in the hamming code encoder to reduce the delay of the circuit, and the parity generated by this module was processed with dual modular redundancy technology, which was used as the output of the DMRH encoder. Then, the combinations of each parity and original code were processed according to the hamming decoding rules, and the revised data and two-bit upset flag were obtained. Through analysis, it was found that when the two-bit upset did not happen in the original code at the same time, the correct output could be obtained according to the two-bit upset flag. Finally, the layout segmentation technology was used to suppress the two-bit upset in the original code, which further improved the reliability of the memory. In this study, three types of DMRH codes with word lengths of 4, 8, and 11 were realized. Compared with other correction codes, results show that the circuit delay of the codes obtained in this study was 85%, 89%, and 96% of the eight-bit hamming code, which was lower than the BCH codes.

However, pattern synthesis is challenging because it is difficult to understand and generate complex structures in patterns. In this paper, we propose an approach based on the layout tree descriptor (LTD) to understand and synthesize patterns from existing ones. The LTD is a binary tree that parametrically describes all primitives, layouts, their dependencies and hierarchies in a pattern. The LTD can be constructed automatically with proposed instance grouping, layout recognition, hyper-primitive matching and tree merging algorithms to realize pattern understanding. To meet specialists’ requirements for detailed modification and recombination of patterns, we designed LTD operations including add, remove, replace and grafting operations to allow users to get new patterns by simply adjusting the LTDs. For stylized synthesis, we gave the computing method of LTD similarity. Therefore, the styles of results and input can be compared and users can control generated serialized results by setting the input pattern weights. To meet user’s implicit preferences and provide novelty in creative design, we propose an evolutionary approach to creative synthesis. The system generates new patterns continuously based on LTD grafting, meanwhile user selection of preferred patterns will guide the direction of evolution. Experiments using the developed prototype system show that our approach can synthesize novel and complex patterns effectively, meeting different requirements in practice and providing plenty of digital textures for products. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Design space exploration; Design tools; Graphical models; Layouts; Patterns; Synthesis","Synthesis (chemical); Textures; Design space exploration; Design tool; GraphicaL model; Layouts; Patterns; Binary trees",,,,,"U01 AI069924, U01 AI115940; U19 AI111276; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID: U01AI069924, U01AI115940, U19AI111276; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 309540; Medical Research Council, MRC: MC_U117588499; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x00F6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF: 166687",,,,,,,,,,,"Goodfellow, I.J., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., Generative adversarial nets (2014) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Montreal, Canada, 2014, pp. 2672-2680; Nguyen, A., Clune, J., Bengio, Y., Dosovitskiy, A., Yosinski, J., Plug & play generative networks: Conditional iterative generation of images in latent space (2017) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Honolulu, Hawaii, USA, 2017, pp. 3510-3520; Reinert, B., Ritschel, T., Seidel, H., Interactive by-example design of artistic packing layouts (2013) ACM Trans.

Furthermore, product lifecycles are becoming shorter due to unbounded and unpredictable customer requirements, thereby requiring reconfigurable and versatile manufacturing systems that underpin the basic building blocks of smart factories. This study introduces a modular factory testbed, emphasizing transformability and modularity under a distributed shop-floor control architecture. The main technologies and methods, being developed and verified through the testbed, are presented from the four aspects of rapid factory transformation: self-layout recognition, rapid workstation and robot reprogramming, inter-layer information sharing, and configurable software for shop-floor monitoring. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Distributed control;

The observationes meteorologicae, which are housed by the Regensburg University Library, are one of the oldest collections of weather data in Europe. Starting in 1771, meteorological data was consistently documented in a standardized form over almost 60 years by several writers. The tabular structure, as well as the unconstrained textual layout of comments and the use of historical characters, propose various challenges in layout and text recognition. We present a customized strategy to digitize tabular and handwritten data by combining various state-of-the-art methods for OCR processing to fit the collection. Since the recognition of historical documents still poses major challenges, we provide lessons learned from experimental testing during the first project stages. Our results show that deep learning methods can be used for text recognition and layout detection. However, they are less efficient for the recognition of tabular structures. Furthermore, a tailored approach had to be developed for the historical meteorological characters during the manual creation of ground truth data. The customized system achieved an accuracy rate of 82% for the text recognition of the heterogeneous handwriting and 87% accuracy for layout recognition of the tables. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Document recognition; Handwritten text recognition; Historical documents; Table recognition","Deep learning; History; Learning systems; Meteorology; Optical character recognition; Experimental testing; Ground truth data; Historical characters; Historical documents; Historical weather datum; Meteorological data; State-of-the-art methods; University libraries; Digital libraries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, R., Collections 2021: the future of the library collection is not a collection, , https://serials.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/24211/, Accessed 5 June 2020; Novy, L., Bibliotheken zwischen tradition und Fortschritt: Bewahren und Bewegen, , https://www.goethe.de/ins/fr/de/kul/sup/nlc/21296095.html, Accessed 5 June 2020; Neuroth, H., Bibliothek, Archiv, Museum (2017) Digital Humanities: Eine Einführung, pp. 123-213. , J.B.

Using the “topic model” method to analyse these data, one can characterise thematic relationships between citation contexts from citing and the cited paper content. However, to build relevant topic models and to compare them accurately for papers linked by citation relationships we have to know the semantic labels of PDF papers' layout such as section titles, paragraph boundaries, etc. Recent achievements in papers' conversion from a PDF form into a rich attributed JSON format allow us to develop new approaches for the logical labelling of the papers' layout. This paper presents a re-usable method and open source software for the logical labelling of PDF papers, which gave good quality of a layout element's recognition for a set of research papers. Using these semantic labels we made a precise comparison of topic models built for citing and cited papers and we found some level of similarity between them.

These documents are converted into digital form using Tibetan document segmentation and recognition methods. The document digitization is of great significance for the research, protection and inheritance of Tibetan history. This paper proposes an overall segmentation and recognition framework for historical Tibetan document images. Firstly, the historical Tibetan document image is preprocessed to correct imbalanced illumination, tilt and noises, and is further transformed into the binarized image. Secondly, we propose a layout segmentation method based on block projection to segment Tibetan document images into texts, lines and frames. Thirdly, in order to solve the problems of touching strokes between text-lines and curvilinear text-lines, we present a text-line segmentation method based on graph model for historical Tibetan text-line segmentation. Lastly, we present a touching segmentation method to segment touching Tibetan character string, and then recognize Tibetan characters. Experimental results show our proposed methods on layout segmentation, text-line segmentation and touching character string segmentation, achieve the satisfactory performance. The proposed methods can also be applied to other fonts in Tibetan font family. © 2013 IEEE.","block projection; Historical Tibetan document; layout segmentation; text-line segmentation; touching character string segmentation","Character recognition; History; block projection; Character strings; Document segmentation; Recognition methods; Segmentation methods; Text line segmentation; Tibetans; Touching character; Image segmentation",,,,,"2016-ZJ-Y04; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61672070, 61772505; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS: XXH13505-03-203; Beijing Municipal Education Commission: KZ201910005008; Basic Research Program of Jiangsu Province: 2016-ZJ-740","This work was supported by the Key Project of Beijing Municipal Education Commission (No. KZ201910005008), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 61772505 and Grant 61672070, the Informationization Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XXH13505-03-203), the Innovation Platform Construction of Qinghai Province (No. 2016-ZJ-Y04), and the Basic Research Program of Qinghai Province (No. 2016-ZJ-740).

Despite their importance, large-scale annotated Indic manuscript image datasets do not exist. To address this deficiency, we introduce Indiscapes, the first ever dataset with multi-regional layout annotations for historical Indic manuscripts. To address the challenge of large diversity in scripts and presence of dense, irregular layout elements (e.g. text lines, pictures, multiple documents per image), we adapt a Fully Convolutional Deep Neural Network architecture for fully automatic, instance-level spatial layout parsing of manuscript images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed architecture on images from the Indiscapes dataset. For annotation flexibility and keeping the non-technical nature of domain experts in mind, we also contribute a custom, web-based GUI annotation tool and a dashboard-style analytics portal. Overall, our contributions set the stage for enabling downstream applications such as OCR and word-spotting in historical Indic manuscripts at scale. © 2019 IEEE.","Deep Networks; Document Layout Parsing; Indic; Palm-leaf manuscripts; Semantic Instance Segmentation","Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Large dataset; Semantics; Cultural heritages; Document layouts; Downstream applications; Indian subcontinents; Indic; Multiple documents; Palm-leaf manuscripts; Proposed architectures; Network architecture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Reul, C., Dittrich, M., Gruner, M., Case study of a highly automated layout analysis and ocr of an incunabulum: 'der heiligen leben'(1488) (2017) Proc. 2nd Intl.

We present a communication framework between the coordinator, workstation agents, and executors to facilitate the reconfiguration process of manufacturing systems. The message structure of interagent information exchange is extended for the initiation, self-layout recognition, and control program update phases of reconfiguration. To provide more autonomy to a manufacturing system and to synchronize the updated shop floor condition, a self-layout recognition mechanism was developed based on infrared communication that enables each workstation to identify directly linked workstations and share the identified information with other shop floor entities for automatic layout change detection. Furthermore, we propose a message-based reprogramming approach to quickly update, insert, or delete command lines in the existing control program for a specific device in a workstation. We demonstrate a reconfiguration process via the communication framework in a factory testbed consisting of nine main workstations in a laboratory environment. © 2018 IEEE.","Agent communication; reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS); self-layout recognition","Computer aided manufacturing; Computer workstations; Floors; Information dissemination; Network protocols; Agent communications; Communication framework; Distributed manufacturing systems; IEC standards; Rapidly advancing technology; Reconfigurable manufacturing system; Reconfiguration process; self-layout recognition; Manufacture",,,,,"Ministry of Education, MOE: 2017R1D1A1B04036509; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP: 2015-0-00374, TII-18-1311; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP","Manuscript received May 25, 2018; revised October 12, 2018; accepted November 12, 2018.

The untrusted foundry has front-end-of-line (FEOL) layout and the original circuit netlist and attempts to identify critical components on the layout for Trojan insertion. Although defense methods for this scenario have been developed, the corresponding attack technique is not well explored. For instance, Boolean satisfiability (SAT) based bijective mapping attack is mentioned without detailed research. Hence, the defense methods are mostly evaluated with the k-security metric without actual attacks. We provide the first systematic study, to the best of our knowledge, on attack techniques in this scenario. Besides of implementing SAT-based bijective mapping attack, we develop a new attack technique based on structural pattern matching. Experimental comparison with bijective mapping attack shows that the new attack technique achieves about the same success rate with much faster speed for cases without the k-security defense, and has a much better success rate at the same runtime for cases with k-security defense. The results offer an alternative and practical interpretation for k-security in split manufacturing. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Hardware security; Layout recognition attack; Split manufacturing","Computer aided design; Foundries; Hardware security; Manufacture; Mapping; Network security; Pattern matching; Bijective mapping; Boolean satisfiability; Critical component; Experimental comparison; Front end of lines; Recognition attacks; Security metrices; Structural pattern matching; Malware",,,,,"Semiconductor Research Corporation, SRC: 2016-TS-2688, 2016-TS-2689; National Science Foundation, NSF: CNS-1618797, CNS-1618824","This work is partially supported by NSF (CNS-1618824), NSF (CNS-1618797), SRC (2016-TS-2688) and SRC (2016-TS-2689).",,,,,,,,,,"Bi, Y., Yuan, J., Jin, Y., Beyond the interconnections: Split manufacturing in RF designs (2015) MDPI Electronics, pp. 541-564. , 2015; Dupuis, S., Ba, P.S., Di Natale, G., Flottes, M.L., Rouzeyre, B., A novel hardware logic encryption technique for thwarting illegal overproduction and Hardware Trojans (2014) IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium, pp. 49-54. , 2014; Imeson, F., Emtenan, A., Garg, S., Tripunitara, M.V., Securing computer hardware using 3D integrated circuit (IC) technology and split manufacturing for obfuscation (2013) USENIX Conference on Security, pp. 495-510. , 2013; (2011) Trusted Integrated Circuits Program, , https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=b8be3d2c5d5babbdffc6975c370247a6; (2014) iSAT3, , https://projects.avacs.org/projects/isat3; Jarvis, R.W., McIntyre, M.G., (2004) Split Manufacturing Method for Advanced Semiconductor Circuits, , US Patent. 2004; Li, M., Yu, B., Lin, Y., Xu, X., Li, W., Pan, D.Z., A practical split manufacturing framework for trojan prevention via simultaneous wire lifting and cell insertion (2018) ASPDAC, pp. 265-270. , 2018; MagaÃśa, J., Shi, D., Melchert, J., Davoodi, A., Are proximity attacks a threat to the security of split manufacturing of integrated circuits?

Although spreadsheets are intuitive to use and equipped with powerful functionalities, extracting and reusing data from them remains a cumbersome and mostly manual task. Their greatest strength, the large degree of freedom they provide to the user, is at the same time also their greatest weakness, since data can be arbitrarily structured. Therefore, in this paper we propose a supervised learning approach for layout recognition in spreadsheets. We work on the cell level, aiming at predicting their correct layout role, out of five predefined alternatives. For this task we have considered a large number of features not covered before by related work. Moreover, we gather a considerably large dataset of annotated cells, from spreadsheets exhibiting variability in format and content. Our experiments, with five different classification algorithms, show that we can predict cell layout roles with high accuracy. Subsequently, in this paper we focus on revising the classification results, with the aim of repairing misclassifications. We propose a sophisticated approach, composed of three steps, which effectively corrects a reasonable number of inaccurate predictions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Analysis; Classification; Document; Layout; Recognition; Speadsheet; Table; Tabular","Cells; Classification (of information); Cytology; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Forecasting; Information retrieval systems; Knowledge engineering; Knowledge management; Spreadsheets; Analysis; Document; Layout; Recognition; Speadsheet; Table; Tabular; Data mining",,,,,"European Commission, EC: IT4BI-DC","Acknowledgments.

In this paper, we propose an effective approach for security issue of handwriting documents in spatial domain by making use of watermarking technique. To begin with, the handwritten document is pre-processed by replacing gray level values holding high intensity with the mean value of document content. The document is then transformed into standard form to minimize geometric distortion. Next, fully convolutional networks (FCN) is leveraged to detect document's watermarking regions used for hiding secret information wherein an approach of FCN for document layout segmentation is adjusted to solve the problem of watermarking region detection. Lastly, the data hiding process is conducted by dividing gray level values of each connected object situated within watermarking regions into two sets for carrying one watermark bit. The experiments are performed on various handwritten documents, and our approach achieves high performance regarding such properties as imperceptibility and robustness against distortions caused by JPEG compression, geometric transformation and print-and-scan process. © 2018 IEEE.","document analysis; FCN; handwritten document security; watermarking; watermarking regions","Character recognition; Convolution; Digital watermarking; Image compression; Mathematical transformations; Watermarking; Convolutional networks; Document analysis; Document examinations; Geometric transformations; Handwriting documents; Handwritten document; Print and scan process; Watermarking algorithms; Network security",,,,,"European Commission, EC; Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","This work is supported by the CPER NUMERIC programme funded by the Region Nouvelle Aquitaine, CDA, Charente Maritime French Department, La Rochelle conurbation authority (CDA) and the European Union through the FEDER funding.","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by the CPER NUMERIC programme funded by the Region Nouvelle Aquitaine, CDA, Charente Maritime French Department, La Rochelle conurbation authority (CDA) and the European Union through the FEDER funding.",,,,,,,,,"Kim, Y.W., Moon, K., Oh, I.S., A text watermarking algorithm based on word classification and inter-word space statistics (2003) ICDAR '03; Hu, S., Document image watermarking based on weight-invariant partition using support vector machine (2004) DAS, 4; Kim, Y.W., Seok, O., Watermarking text document images using edge direction histograms (2004) Pattern Recogn.

Road layout parsing is fundamentally important to this, and has attracted deserved attention on the urban road net where traffic signs are well established. However, for the unmarked traffic scenes, like campus and residence community, the large variation on individual surroundings leads to a reduced attention on public research and a lack of both available dataset and generic methods. To explore this issue, we present a novel automatic annotation method to analyze road semantics, which regards the prior trajectories of a vehicle as multi-dimensional space series and extends the traditional time series methods to the space domain to process the data. In order to achieve this, we first propose Incremental Dynamic Space Warping (IDSW) to synchronize space series and extract statistical road feature, then a Bayesian nonparametric method based on the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) is introduced to generate road semantic sections without explicitly specifying the number of class.

To address those problems, a new approach for questionnaire layout analysis based on regional connectivity and neural networks is proposed. First, a center valid graphics is generated by preprocessing the scanned image firstly. Then, a rapid skew correction algorithm is applied for questionnaire images. Next, many questionnaire rows are obtained by using horizontal projection profile segmentation algorithms. After that, the first connected region for each row is extracted to estimate the existence of form region. Based on the analysis of general questionnaire row and table row, a large amount of possible answers region are generated. Finally, the neural network is used to determine the type of possible information areas. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can automatically identify common questionnaire. © Copyright 2017, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

It is a scribble-based interactive segmentation approach, where the user draws scribbles on the various regions and the system performs page layout segmentation. The user can correct and refine the resulting segmentation by drawing new scribbles. To classify the various regions of the page, we apply a bank of Gabor filters, in several orientations and multiple frequencies, to capture the orientation, the stroke width, and size of the text. These properties also implicitly encode the writing style of the document. After combining the responses of the Gabor filter into a feature matrix, we classify various regions of the document by applying graph cuts, while taking into account the user made scribbles. The presented approach is very fast, easy to use, robust to user interaction, and provides accurate results. © 2016 IEEE.","Gabor filter; Interactive system; Page segmentation; Scribble-based","Character recognition; Graphic methods; Feature matrices; Interactive approach; Interactive pages; Interactive segmentation; Interactive system; Multiple frequency; Page segmentation; Scribble-based; Gabor filters",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Antonacopoulos, A., Downton, A.C., Special issue on the analysis of historical documents (2007) International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition, 9 (2), pp. 75-77; Blake, A., Rother, C., Brown, M., Perez, P., Torr, P., Interactive image segmentation using an adaptive gmmrf model (2004) Computer Vision-ECCV 2004., pp. 428-441. , Springer; Protiere, A., Sapiro, G., Interactive image segmentation via adaptive weighted distances (2007) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 16 (4), pp. 1046-1057. , April; Price, B.L., Morse, B., Cohen, S., Geodesic graph cut for interactive image segmentation (2010) Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2010 IEEE Conference on, pp. 3161-3168. , June; Boykov, Y., Funka-Lea, G., Graph cuts and efficient nd image segmentation (2006) International Journal of Computer Vision, 70 (2), pp. 109-131; Boykov, Y.Y., Jolly, M.-P., Interactive graph cuts for optimal boundary & region segmentation of objects in nd images (2001) Computer Vision, 2001.

Within three years, the project processed more than 10 million pages of historical newspapers from 12 national and major libraries to produce the largest open access and fully searchable text collection of digital historical newspapers in Europe. In this, a wide variety of legal, logistical, technical and other challenges were encountered. After introducing the background issues in newspaper digitization in Europe, the paper discusses the technical aspects of refinement in greater detail. It explains what decisions were taken in the design of the large-scale processing workflow to address these challenges, what were the results produced and what were identified as best practices. © 2016 IEEE.","digital libraries; historical newspapers; large-scale digitisation; layout analysis; optical character recognition","Character recognition; Digital libraries; Newsprint; Optical character recognition; Best practices; Digitisation; Historical newspapers; Large-scale processing; Layout analysis; Open Access; Technical aspects; Text collection; Electronic publishing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"http//www.europeananewspapers.eu/, Europeana Newspapers Project; http//www.enumerate.eu/, Project ENUMERATE; http//www.europeana.eu/portal/, Europeana; http//www.loc.gov/standards/mets/, Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard; http//www.loc.gov/standards/alto/, Analyzed Layout and Text Object; http//www.europeana-newspapers.eu/wpcontent/uploads/2015/05/ENP-Deliverable_4.1_final.pdf, Europeana Newspapers Survey Report; Dunning, A., Neudecker, C., Representation and absence in digital resources: The case of europeana newspapers (2014) Presented at Digital Humanities 2014, , http//dharchive.org/paper/DH2014/Paper-773.xml, Lausanne, Switzerland, 7-12 July; Gatos, B., Pratikakis, I., Perantonis, S.J., Adaptive degraded document image binarisation (2006) Pattern Recognition, 39 (3), pp. 317-327. , March; Pletschacher, S., Clausner, C., Antonacopoulos, A., Europeana newspapers ocr workflow evaluation (2015) Proc 2015 Workshop on Historical Document Imaging and Processing (HIP2015), pp. 39-46. , Nancy, France; http//iipimage.sourceforge.net/, IIPImage server; http//iiif.io/, International Image Interoperability Framework; http//kakadusoftware.com/, Kakadu JPEG2000 software development kit; https//abbyy.technology/en:products:fre:start, ABBYY FineReader Engine; http//contentconversion.com/#docworks-2, Content Conversion Specialists docWorks; Hebert, D., Palfray, T., Nicolas, S., Tranouez, P., Paquet, T., Automatic article extraction in old newspapers digitized collections Proc First International Conference on Digital Access to Textual Cultural Heritage (DATeCH 2014), pp. 3-8. , ACM, New York, NY, USA; Antonacopoulos, A., Clausner, C., Papadopoulos, C., Pletschacher, S., ICDAR2013 Competition on historical newspaper layout analysis-hnla2013 (2013) Proc 12th Int Conf on Doc Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR2013), pp. 1486-1490. , Washington DC, USA; Neudecker, C., Wilms, L., Faber, W.J., Van Veen, T., Largescale refinement of digital historic newspapers with named entity recognition (2014) Proc IFLA Newspapers/GENLOC Pre-Conference Satellite Meeting, , Geneva, Switzerland, 13-14 August; Finkel, J.R., Grenager, T., Manning, C., Incorporating non-local information into information extraction systems by gibbs sampling Proc 43rd Annual Meeting of the Assoc for Comput Linguistics (ACL 2005), pp. 363-370. , http//nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/papers/gibbscrf3.pdf; Gooding, P., Exploring usage of digital newspaper archives through web log analysis: A case study of welsh newspapers online (2014) Presented at Digital Humanities 2014, , http//dharchive.org/paper/DH2014/Paper-310.xml, Lausanne, Switzerland, 7-12 July; http//www.europeana-newspapers.eu/wpcontent/uploads/2015/05/D3.5_Performance_Evaluation_Report_1.0.pdf, Europeana Newspapers Performance Evaluation Report; http//www.europeana-newspapers.eu/wpcontent/uploads/2015/05/D5.3_Final_release_ENMAP_1.0.pdf, Europeana Newspapers METS/ALTO Profile (ENMAP); http//www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers, The European Library Historic Newspapers; Clausner, C., Papadopoulos, C., Pletschacher, S., Antonacopoulos, A., The ENP image and ground truth dataset of historical newspapers (2015) Proc 13th Int Conf on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR2015), pp. 931-935. , Nancy, France; http//research.europeana.eu/itemtype/newspapers, Europeana Research; https//github.com/EuropeanaNewspapers, Europeana Newspapers GitHub; http//europeananewspapers.github.io/, Europeana Newspapers Final Report",,,"ABBYY;et al.;Family Search;HP;IAPR;iTESOFT","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","12th IAPR International Workshop on Document Analysis Systems, DAS 2016","11 April 2016 through 14 April 2016",,122291,,9781509017928,,,"English","Proc. - IAPR Int.

Document object categories often share primitives from a low-level perspective (e.g. regions inside bars in a bar chart resemble background), making it difficult to evaluate document layout segmentation methods based on pixel classification, as most datasets and ground truth models focus on document objects. We propose a novel ground truth model that utilizes structural and statistical pattern recognition concepts. Statistical pixel-based data derived from low-level elemental patterns are layered onto high-level structural object-based data. We also present evaluation metrics that take advantage of the layered ground truth model, allowing a contextual evaluation of pixel classification algorithms. We apply the proposed model to two recent pixel classification approaches, evaluated on business document images that exhibit a challenging mixture of textual, graphical, and pictorial elements through varied layouts. The proposed model allows to obtain very detailed, comprehensive, and intuitive information on the strengths and limitations of the evaluated approaches that would be impossible to obtain through other models. © 2016 IEEE.","Document image dataset; Document layout analysis; Ground truth; Image segmentation; Performance evaluation; Statistical pattern; Structural pattern","Classification (of information); Digital image storage; Image analysis; Image segmentation; Pattern recognition; Pixels; Semantics; Structural analysis; Document images; Document layout analysis; Ground truth; Performance evaluations; Statistical pattern; Structural pattern; Information retrieval systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Namboodiri, A., Jain, A., Document structure and layout analysis (2007) Digital Document Processing, pp. 29-48; Moll, M.A., Baird, H.S., An, C., Truthing for pixel-accurate segmentation (2008) Proc.

In this paper, we have proposed a framework for the matching and retrieval of similar architectural floorplans under the query by example paradigm. We propose a room layout segmentation and adjacent room detection algorithm to represent layouts as an undirected graph. We have also proposed a novel graph spectral embedding feature to uniquely represent the layout of the architectural floorplan. This helps in effective and efficient matching of the room layouts. Room semantics in terms of both the room structures and room decor is used to retrieve similar floorplans from the repository. To match the semantic similarity between a pair of floorplans, we have proposed a two stage matching technique. We have validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework by performing experiments on publicly available floorplan dataset and achieved high retrieval accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Semantics; Detection algorithm; Graph spectral; Query-by example; Retrieval accuracy; Semantic matching; Semantic similarity; Undirected graph; Unified framework; Pattern recognition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dosch, P., Masini, G., Reconstruction of the 3d structure of a building from the 2d drawings of its oors (1999) ICDAR; Macé, S., Locteau, H., Valveny, E., Tabbone, S., A system to detect rooms in architectural oor plan images (2010) IWDAS; Ahmed, S., Weber, M., Liwicki, M., Langenhan, C., Dengel, A., Petzold, F., Automatic analysis and sketch-based retrieval of architectural oor plans (2014) Pattern Recognition Letters, 35, pp. 91-100; Lambert, G., Gao, H., Line moments and invariants for real time processing of vectorized contour data (1995) IAP; Dutta, A., Llados, J., Pal, U., Symbol spotting in line drawings through graph paths hashing (2011) ICDAR; Weber, M., Liwicki, M., Dengel, A.A., Scatch-a sketch-based retrieval for architectural oor plans (2010) ICFHR; Bay, H., Ess, A., Tuytelaars, T., Van Gool, L., Speeded-up robust features (SURF) (2008) CVIU, 110 (3), pp. 346-359; Aoki, Y., Shio, A., Arai, H., Odaka, K., A prototype system for interpreting hand-sketched oor plans (1996) ICPR; Lladós, J., López-Krahe, J., Mart, E., A system to understand handdrawn oor plans using subgraph isomorphism and hough transform (1997) Machine Vision and Applications, 10 (3), pp. 150-158; Ahmed, S., Liwicki, M., Weber, M., Dengel, A., Automatic room detection and room labeling from architectural oor plans (2012) DAS; Improved automatic analysis of architectural oor plans (2011) ICDAR; De Las Heras, L.-P., Sánchez, G., And-or graph grammar for architectural oor plan representation, learning and recognition. a semantic, structural and hierarchical model (2011) ICPRIA, pp. 17-24. , Springer; Bunke, H., Graph matching: Theoretical foundations, algorithms, and applications (2000) Proc.

Document segmentation is defined as the technique in which we chunk or partition our both homogeneous or heterogeneous data. Heterogeneous data is called as the data which contains printed text or handwritten text or graph or all of these together in one single document .Segmentation of the document is required because OCR is not able to recognize the whole document which contains multiple data types. Therefore first of all document segmentation is to be applied on handwritten bills which contain heterogeneous data type in order to differentiate between printed text and handwritten text. © 2016 International Science Press.","Documentation.

The sparse degree was employed as the feature description of page regions. Then the threshold segmentation was applied to obtain the category labels according to the difference between contents and the backgrounds. Our approach was tested on a complex layout image set. The experimental results, accurate rate 74.1% and the computation time 1.61 seconds, show the effectiveness and rapidity of our method.

Traditionally, the 3D layout is derived by solving a pixel-level classification problem. However, the image-level 3D structure can be very beneficial for extracting pixel-level 3D layout since it implies the way how pixels in the image are organized. In this paper, we propose an approach that first predicts the global image structure, and then we use the global structure for fine-grained pixel-level 3D layout extraction. In particular, image features are extracted based on multiple layout templates. We then learn a discriminative model for classifying the global layout at the image-level. Using latent variables, we implicitly model the sublevel semantics of the image, which enrich the expressiveness of our model. After the image-level structure is obtained, it is used as the prior knowledge to infer pixel-wise 3D layout. Experiments show that the results of our model outperform the state-of-the-art methods by 11.7% for 3D structure classification. Moreover, we show that employing the 3D structure prior information yields accurate 3D scene layout segmentation. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","3D layout; Stage classification; Structural SVM","Image analysis; Pixels; Semantics; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D layouts; Discriminative models; Image Structures; Object localization; Prior information; State-of-the-art methods; Structural SVM; Video categorization; Image processing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nedović, V., Smeulders, A.W.M., Redert, A., Geusebroek, J.-M., Stages as models of scene geometry (2010) IEEE Trans.

Document image processing (DIP) is an important problem related with most of the challenges coming from the image processing field and with applications to digital document summarization, readers for the visually impaired etc. Difficulties in the processing of documents can arise from lighting conditions, page curl, page rotation in 3D, and page layout segmentation. Document image processing is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require an undistorted document image such as optical character recognition and document restoration/preservation. Typically, assumptions are made to constrain the processing problem in the context of a particular application. In this survey, we categorize document image processing methods on the basis of the technique, provide detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category, and examine their pros and cons. It important to notice here that the DIP field is broad, thus we try to provide a top-down/horizontal survey rather a bottom up. At the same time, we target the area of document readers for the blind, and use this application to guide us in a top-down survey of DIP. Moreover, we present a comparative survey based on important aspects of a marketable system that is dependent on document image processing techniques. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Document image processing; document image segmentation; page curl correction; skew correction","Digital image storage; Image segmentation; Optical character recognition; Optical data processing; Processing; Surveys; Assistive technology; Automatic document processing; Document image processing; Document image segmentation; Document restoration; Lighting conditions; Processing problems; Skew corrections; Information retrieval systems",,,,,,"The authors express their appreciation to their colleagues in the Assistive Technology Research Center for their inputs and contributions in this paper.

We aim to address issues concerning dynamic multimedia signage where the content are divided into several sections. This type of signage has become increasingly popular due to optimal content exposures. In contrast to prior research, our approach excludes computer vision based object recognition, and instead took an approach to identify how contents are being laid-out in a digital signage. We incorporate techniques to recognize basic layout features including corners, lines, edges, and line segments; which are obtained from the camera frame taken by the user using their own device. Consequently, these layout features are combined to generate signage layout map, which is then compared to pre-learned layout map for position detection and perspective correction using homography estimation. To grab a specific content, users are able to choose a section within the captured layout using the device’s interface, which in turn creates a request to contents server to send respective content information based on a timestamp and a unique section ID. In this paper, we describe implementation details, report user study results, and conclude with discussion of our experiences in implementation as well as highlighting future work. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Computer vision; Digital signage; Layout recognition; Line segment; Multi section; Public display; Public-to-private; User study; Visual features","Computer vision; Digital devices; Display devices; Electronic document exchange; Glass; Object recognition; Digital signage; Layout recognition; Line segment; Multi-section; Public display; Public-to-private; User study; Visual feature; Human computer interaction",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"She, J., Crowcroft, J., Fu, H., Li, F., Convergence of interactive displays with smart mobile devices for effective advertising: A survey (2014) ACM Trans.

However, as the lexicon grows, the computation time increases. In this paper, we present the Arabic word descriptor (AWD) for Arabic word shape indexing and lexicon reduction in handwritten documents. It is formed in two stages. First, the structural descriptor (SD) is computed for each connected component (CC) of the word image. It describes the CC shape using the bag-of-words model, where each visual word represents a different local shape structure, extracted from the image with filters of different patterns and scales. Then, the AWD is formed by sorting and normalizing the SDs. This emphasizes the symbolic features of Arabic words, such as subwords and diacritics, without performing layout segmentation. In the context of lexicon reduction, the AWD is used to index a reference database. Given a query image, the reduced lexicon is obtained from the labels of the first entries in the indexed database. This framework has been tested on Arabic word databases. It has a low computational overhead, while providing a compact descriptor, with state-of-the-art results for lexicon reduction on the Ibn Sina and IFN/ENIT databases. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Arabic handwritten documents; Arabic word descriptor; Holistic representation; Ibn Sina database; IFN/ENIT; Lexicon reduction; Shape indexing","Database systems; Information retrieval; Query processing; Vocabulary control; Arabic handwritten documents; Descriptors; Holistic representation; Ibn Sina database; IFN/ENIT; Lexicon reductions; Shape indexing; Indexing (of information)",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC: CRSNG RGPIN 138344; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC: CRSH 412-2010-1007","The authors thank the NSERC (CRSNG RGPIN 138344) and SSHRC (CRSH 412-2010-1007 (via McGill)) of Canada for their financial support and the reviewers for their constructive and helpful suggestions.",,,,,,,,,,"Lorigo, L.M., Govindaraju, V., Offline Arabic handwriting recognition a survey (2006) IEEE Trans.

In this article, we propose to search the homogeneous regions from the content of historical digitized books with little a priori knowledge by extracting and analyzing texture features. The novelty of this work lies in the unsupervised clustering of the extracted texture descriptors to find homogeneous regions, i.e. graphic and textual regions, by performing the clustering approach on an entire book instead of processing each page individually. We propose firstly to characterize the content of an entire book by extracting the texture information of each page, as our goal is to compare and index the content of digitized books. The extraction of texture features, computed without any hypothesis on the document structure, is based on two non-parametric tools: the autocorrelation function and multiresolution analysis. Secondly, we perform an unsupervised clustering approach on the extracted features in order to classify automatically the homogeneous regions of book pages. The clustering results are assessed by internal and external accuracy measures. The overall results are quite satisfying. Such analysis would help to construct a computer-aided categorization tool of pages. © 2013 IEEE.","autocorrelation; clustering accuracy metrics; consensus clustering; Historical books; homogeneity; multiresolution; pixel labeling; texture","Clustering accuracy; Consensus clustering; Historical books; homogeneity; Multiresolution; Pixel labeling; Autocorrelation; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Computer aided analysis; Pixels; Tools; Textures",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wong, K., Casey, R., Wahl, F., Document analysis system (1982) IBM Journal of Research and Development, pp. 647-656; Pavlidis, T., Zhou, J., Page segmentation and classification (1992) Graphical Model and Image Processing, pp. 484-496; Khedekar, S., Ramanaprasad, V., Setlur, S., Govindaraju, V., Text-image separation in devanagari documents (2003) IJDAR.

The method works in two steps. In the first step, layout analysis is performed to recognize the physical structure of a given document using a classification technique, more precisely the pixels of a coloured document image are classified into five classes: text-block, core-text-line, decoration, background, and periphery. This layout recognition is achieved by a cascade of two Dynamic Multilayer Perceptron (DMLP) classifiers and works without binarisation. In the second step, an algorithm takes the layout recognition results as an input, extracts the text lines, and groups them into blocks using the connected components approach. Finally, the algorithm refines the boundaries of the text lines using the binary image and the layout recognition results. Our system is evaluated on three historical manuscripts with a test set of 49 pages. The best obtained hit rate for text lines is 96.3%. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Classification technique; Connected component; Document images; Historical documents; Layout analysis; Multi layer perceptron; Physical structures; Text-line extractions; Algorithms; Classification (of information); History; Information retrieval systems; Text processing; Character recognition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fischer, A., Bunke, H., Naji, N., Savoy, J., Baechler, M., Ingold, R., The hisdoc project.

Therefore, in order to control the quality of historical document image digitization and to meet the need of a characterization of their content using intermediate level metadata (between image and document structure), we propose a fast automatic layout segmentation of old document images based on five descriptors. Those descriptors, based on the autocorrelation function, are obtained by multiresolution analysis and used afterwards in a specific clustering method. The method proposed in this article has the advantage that it is performed without any hypothesis on the document structure, either about the document model (physical structure), or the typographical parameters (logical structure). It is also parameter-free since it automatically adapts to the image content. In this paper, firstly, we detail our proposal to characterize the content of old documents by extracting the autocorrelation features in the different areas of a page and at several resolutions. Then, we show that is possible to automatically find the homogeneous regions defined by similar indices of autocorrelation without knowledge about the number of clusters using adapted hierarchical ascendant classification and consensus clustering approaches. To assess our method, we apply our algorithm on 316 old document images, which encompass six centuries (1200-1900) of French history, in order to demonstrate the performance of our proposal in terms of segmentation and characterization of heterogeneous corpus content. Moreover, we define a new evaluation metric, the homogeneity measure, which aims at evaluating the segmentation and characterization accuracy of our methodology. We find a 85% of mean homogeneity accuracy. Those results help to represent a document by a hierarchy of layout structure and content, and to define one or more signatures for each page, on the basis of a hierarchical representation of homogeneous blocks and their topology. © 2013 SPIE-IS&T.","autocorrelation;

This article proposed an algorithm for the scanned document image segmentation based on Voronoi diagram. The algorithm does not need additional tilt detection to oblique layout and pretreatment process for tilt correction, Voronoi diagram generated directly on the outer edge of the connected element, not related to the pixel processing, The algorithm does not need the processing to delete redundancy Voronoi edges and merger Voronoi edges, greatly reducing excessive segmentation of the other algorithm. The algorithm can fully identify each area of the document image, and the segmentation is accurate with very little information lost. In addition, because the structural elements were performed using statistical features, the adaptability of the algorithm is better. © 2012 IEEE.","scanned document image; segmentation algorithm; Voronoi diagram","Document images; Information lost; Pixel processing; Pretreatment process; Scanned document images; Segmentation algorithms; Statistical features; Structural elements; Tilt correction; Tilt detection; Voronoi; Voronoi diagrams; Computational geometry; Computer science; Digital image storage; Electronics engineering; Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Algorithms",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Xiao, Y., Yan, H., Text region extraction in a document image based on the Delaunay tessellation (2003) Pattern Recognition, 36, pp. 799-809; Liu, H., Wu, Q., Zha, H.B., Liu, X.P., Skew detection for complex document images using robust borderlines in both text and non-text regions (2008) Pattern Recognition Letters, 29, pp. 1893-1900; Kumar, S., Gupta, R., Khanna, N., Text extraction and document image segmentation using matched wavelets and MRF model (2007) IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 16, pp. 1057-1061; Cheng, H., Background identification based segmentation and multiplayer tree representation of document images (2002) International Conference on IEEE Image Processing, 3, pp. 1005-1008; Yi, J., Peng, Y., Xiao, J., Color-based clustering for text detection and extraction in image (2007) Proceedings of 15th International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 847-850. , Augsburg, Germany; Acharyya, M., Kundu, M.K., Document image segmentation using wavelet scale-space features (2002) IEEE Trans.On Circuit and Systems for Video Technology, 12, pp. 1117-1127; Chen, Y.-K., Hu, K.-T., Classification of a text and a graphics images with asymmetrical filters (2008) 2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing, pp. 476-480. , Hainan, China; Li, S., Kwok, J.T., Text extraction using edge detection and morphological dilation (2004) Proceedings of 2004 International Symposium on Intelligent Multimedia, Video and Speech Processing, pp. 330-333. , October20-22","Zhang, J.; Department of Computer, , Shijiazhuang, China; email: zhjshd1@sina.com",,"Xi'an Technological University;Shaanxi New Network and Monitoring Control Engineering Laboratory",,"2012 International Conference on Computer Science and Electronics Engineering, ICCSEE 2012","23 March 2012 through 25 March 2012","Hangzhou, Zhejiang",89726,,9780769546476,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

For certain types of textual documents, such as journal arlicles, pamphlets, official government records, eie, where the metadata is contained within the body of the documents, a cost effective method is to identify and extract the metadata in an automated way, applying machine learning and string pattern search techniques. Al the U. S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) we have developed an automated metadata extraction (AME) system that employs layout classification and recognition models with a metadata pattern search model for a text corpus with structured or semi-structured Information. A combination of Support Vector Machine and Hidden Markov Model is used to create the layout recognition models from a training set of the corpus, following which a rule-based metadata search model is used to extract the embedded metadata by analyzing the string patterns within and surrounding each field in the recognized layouts. In this paper, we describe the design of our AME system, with focus on the metadata search model. We present the extraction results for a historic collection from the Food and Drug Administration, and outline how the system may be adapted for similar collections. Finally, we discuss seme ongoing enhancements to our AME system.",,"Automated extraction; Classification and recognition; Cost-effective methods; Digital Documents; Food and Drug Administration; Government records; Machine-learning; Metadata extraction; National library of medicines; Pattern search; Recognition models; Rule based; Search models; Semi-structured information; Text corpora; Textual documents; Training sets; Automation; Character recognition; Copying; Hidden Markov models; Historic preservation; Imaging techniques; Pattern recognition systems; Societies and institutions; Text processing; Metadata",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Flynn, P., Zhou, L., Maly, K., Zeil, S., Zubair, M., Automated template-based metadata extraction architecture Proc.

We use the layout information recognized in the latter step to correct the character recognition errors by using two sources of information. One is based on some keywords such as mathematical function names, and the other is based on a cost tree and co-occurrence probabilities between symbols.

The purpose of this study is to develop a simple model that can predict mask write time precisely, without an e-beam writer. With a good understanding of the trade-offs between design complexity and write time, mask makers can work with mask designers more closely to simplify design and minimize mask cost. This work compared several basic models including calculations based on write area with a fixed e-beam shot size, a software estimation with a pre-set exposure, and a mask stage settling time. Our proposed model uses a completely different approach to examine the correlation between layout complexity (vertices count, total line edge, figure, etc.) through a CATS layout segmentation and actual write time. It is found that write time is a strong function of layout figure, vertex count and total line edge. Errors between actual write time and estimated write time from the new model reduced from 7% on average on the current production software to 3%. Additionally, the new model can operate independent of the writer type and without fractured data being transferred onto a writer. Also provided are a few case studies to evaluate the interaction between write time and basic shape/OPC (optical proximity correction). Using a simple design shape and a better data snapping strategy can reduce write time up to 10 fold for applications in nano-imprint template manufacturing. Several strategies to reduce mask cost are proposed.","CATS; Design optimization; Mask write time; OPC; Vertex","CATS; Mask write time; OPC; Vertex; Data acquisition; Image segmentation; Optical correlation; Optical design; Optical engineering; Optical systems; Cost benefit analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zhang, Y.; Photronics, 601 Millennium Drive, Allen, TX 75013, United States","Liebmann L.W.","SPIE",,"Design and Process Integration for Microelectronic Manufacturing III","3 March 2005 through 4 March 2005","San Jose, CA",65652,0277786X,,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25144436352

These form a chain of search-and-act sensory-motor loops that exit when a condition is met. In this paper we investigate the nature of these chunks in an urban visual navigation context, and propose a method for implementing the corresponding robot primitives such as ""take the nth turn right/left"". These primitives make use of a ""short-lived"" internal map updated as the robot moves along. The recognition and localisation of intersections is done in the map using task-guided template matching.

The first stage, preprocessing, extracts statistical information that may be used for background detection and removal. The second stage, a tree based classifier, uses a variable block size and a set of probabilistic rules to classify segmented blocks. When a block cannot be classified at a given block size because contains more than one class, it is split in four sub-blocks that are independently classified. The third stage, postprocessing, uses the label map generated in the second stage with a set of context rules to label unclassified blocks, trying also to solve some of the misclassification errors that may have been generated during the previous stage. The progressive scheme used in the second and third stages allows the user to stop the classification process at any block size, depending on his requirements. Experiments show that a progressive scheme combined with a set of postprocessing rules increases the percentage of correctly classified blocks and reduces the number of block computations.",,"Image coding; Image compression; Image quality; Information analysis; Information retrieval systems; Probability; Document analysis; Document layout recognition; Progressive classification tree; Wavelet packets; Pattern recognition systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Minguillon, Julia; Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain",,"SPIE","Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers, Bellingham, WA, United States","Proceedings of the 1999 Mathematical Modeling, Bayesian Estimation, and Inverse Problems","21 July 1999 through 23 July 1999","Denver, CO, USA",55577,0277786X,,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033359405

Until today, many methods/approaches have been proposed with regard to recognition of various kinds of documents, various technical problems for extensions of OCR, and requirements for practical usages. Of course, though the technical research issues in the early stage are looked upon as complementary attacks for the traditional OCR which is dependent on character recognition techniques, the application ranges or related issues are widely investigated or should be established progressively. This paper addresses current topics about document image understanding from a technical point of view as a survey.","Bottom-up; Document model; Document types; Layout recognition; Layout structure; Logical structure; Top-down","Data structures; Database systems; Feature extraction; Image analysis; Knowledge representation; Optical character recognition; Character recognition techniques; Document image understanding; Paper based documents; Image understanding",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baird, H.S., Anatomy of a page reader Proc.

First, we define the physical layout structure and logical layout structure in addition to the traditional concepts of layout structure and logical structure. Second, we define the document type on the basis of the relationship between the physical layout structure and logical layout structure. Third, we make the knowledge representation means and the processing mechanisms clear under the document types.

In Experiment 1, participants learned the locations of objects on a desktop from a single perspective and then took part in a recognition test; test scenes included familiar and novel views of the layout. Recognition latency was a linear function of the angular distance between a test view and the study view. In Experiment 2, participants studied a layout from a single view and then learned to recognize the layout from three additional training views. A final recognition test showed that the study view and the training views were represented in memory, and that latency was a linear function of the angular distance to the nearest study or training view. These results indicate that interobject spatial relations are encoded in a viewpoint-dependent manner, and that recognition of novel views requires normalization to the most similar representation in memory.

Info. Engineering, School of Engineering, Toyama University, 3190 Gofuku, Toyama 930, Japan","The items in documents are composed under the mutual relationship between geometrical layout structure and logical structure. Thus, currently used documents may be categorized roughly on the basis of the geometrical layout structure and logical structure. Table-form documents are strictly defined by the geometrical layout structure in comparison with the other documents. Since the item fields are, in general, surrounded with vertical and horizontal line segments, with a view to understanding table-form documents it is better to recognize these line segments first and then identify individual item fields on the basis of the recognition results. At least, in table-form documents the vertical and horizontal line segments take important roles in recognizing the layout structures. In this article, we address a multilayer recognition method for understanding table-form documents. Our recognition layers are composed hierarchically of four different recognition processes: document class recognition, layout recognition, item recognition, and character recognition. In addition, our recognition method is organized on the basis of the interaction paradigm that the lower-layer recognition process verifies objects interpreted in the upper-layer recognition process with its own knowledge and then decomposes the objects into more elementary and meaningful objects. Moreover, we discuss a knowledge representation method from the viewpoints of physical and logical representations, and syntactic and semantic information. We also show the knowledge that is useful in understanding table-form documents with respect to such a representation method. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, inc.",,"Character recognition; Data processing; Image understanding; Object recognition; Document class recognition; Item recognition; Layout recognition; Multilayer recognition methods; Table form documents; Pattern recognition systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Watanabe, T., Luo, Q., Sugie, N., Structure recognition method for various types of documents (1993) Int.

However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, we propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, we introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. Our recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. © 1995 IEEE","automatic acquisition of layout knowledge; classification tree; recognition of document classes; recognition of layout structures; Recognition paradigm for multi-kinds of table-form documents; structure description tree","Automation; Image understanding; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Trees (mathematics); Classification tree; Layout knowledge; Layout recognition; Layout structures; Structure description tree; Table form documents; Pattern recognition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Watanabe, T., Luo, Q., Sugie, N., A cooperative document understanding method among multiple recognition procedures (1992) Proc. 11th ICPR, pp. 689-692; Watanabe, T., Luo, Q., Yoshida, Y., Inagaki, Y., A stepwise recognition method of library cataloging cards on the basis of various kinds of knowledge (1990) Proc. 10th IPCCC, pp. 821-827; Watanabe, T., Luo, Q., Sugie, N., Toward a practical document understanding of table-form documents: Its framework and knowledge representation (1993) Proc. 2nd ICDAR, pp. 510-515; Niyogi, D., Srihari, S., A rule-based system for document understanding Proc.

Some researches, concerning this issue, have already been reported. However, these methods are not always successful because the recognition procedures analyze document images on the basis of only physical coordinate values of compositive items. In this paper, we propose a more advanced method based on the spatial relationships among neighboring segments of compositive items,in addition to the geometric aspects. In our method, the knowledge about documents is not a single layer,but organized as multilevel layers: knowledge about layout structures, knowledge about item sequences and knowledge about item properties. 3 kinds of knowledge are not only specified hierarchically, but also interrelated mutually between the layout recognition, item recognition and character recognition procedures. Additionally, this paper makes it clear through some experiments that our method for document understanding is very excellent in the adaptability, applicability and flexibility. © 1992 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.
