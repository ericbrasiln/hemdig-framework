However, in various fields such as literature and humanities, many documents to be studied are only scanned to images, but not converted to text data. Optical character recognition (OCR) is a technology to convert scanned document images into text data. However, OCR often misrecognizes characters due to the low quality of the scanned document images, which is a crucial factor that degrades the quality of constructed text corpora. This paper works on corpus construction for historical newspapers. We present a corpus construction method based on a pipeline of image processing, OCR, and filtering. To improve the quality, we further propose to integrate OCR error correction. To this end, we manually construct an OCR error correction dataset in the historical newspaper domain, propose methods to improve a neural OCR correction model and compare various OCR error correction models. We evaluate our corpus construction method on the accuracy of extracting articles of a specific topic to construct a historical newspaper corpus. As a result, our method improves the article extraction F score by 1.7 % via OCR error correction comparing to previous work. This verifies the effectiveness of OCR error correction for corpus construction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Corpus construction; Historical newspapers; OCR error correction; Public meeting",,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN","This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) #19H01330, JSPS.",,"Afli, H., Barrault, L., Schwenk, H., OCR error correction using statistical machine translation (2015) Int J Comput Ling Appl, 7 (1), pp. 175-191; Afli, H., Qiu, Z., Way, A., Sheridan, P., Using SMT for OCR error correction of historical texts (2016) Proceedings of the 10Th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016), pp. 962-966; Barbaresi, A., Bootstrapped OCR error detection for a less-resourced language variant (2016) 13Th Conference on Natural Language Processing (KONVENS 2016), pp. 21-26; Barrault, L., Bojar, O., Costa-Jussà, M.R., Federmann, C., Fishel, M., Graham, Y., Haddow, B., Zampieri, M., Findings of the 2019 conference on machine translation (WMT19) (2019) Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation, 2, pp. 1-61. , Shared Task Papers, Day 1); Cassidy, S., Publishing the Trove newspaper corpus (2016) Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pp. 4520-4525; Chiron, G., Doucet, A., Coustaty, M., Visani, M., Moreux, J.P., Impact of OCR errors on the use of digital libraries: Towards a better access to information (2017) Proceedings of the 17Th ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, JCDL ’17, Pp 249–252; Cho, K., van Merriënboer, B., Gulcehre, C., Bahdanau, D., Bougares, F., Schwenk, H., Bengio, Y., Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 1724-1734; Chu, C., Nakazawa, T., Kurohashi, S., Integrated parallel sentence and fragment extraction from comparable corpora: A case study on chinese–japanese wikipedia (2015) ACM Trans Asian Low-Resour Lang Inform Process, 15 (2), pp. 1-10; Chung, J., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., A character-level decoder without explicit segmentation for neural machine translation (2016) Proceedings of the 54Th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1, pp. 1693-1703. , Long Papers); Davies, M., Expanding horizons in historical linguistics with the 400-million word corpus of historical american english (2012) Corpora, 7, pp. 121-157; Dong, R., Smith, D., Multi-input attention for unsupervised OCR correction (2018) Proceedings of the 56Th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1, pp. 2363-2372. , Long Papers); Duchi, J., Hazan, E., Singer, Y., Adaptive subgradient methods for online learning and stochastic optimization (2011) J Mach Learn Res, 12, pp. 2121-2159; Eger, S., Brück, T., Mehler, A., A comparison of four character-level string-to-string translation models for (ocr) spelling error correction (2016) Prag Bull Math Ling, 106, pp. 77-99; Evershed, J., Fitch, K., Correcting noisy OCR: Context beats confusion (2014) Proceedings of the First International Conference on Digital Access to Textual Cultural Heritage, pp. 45-51; Fujikawa, T., Public meetings in New South Wales: 1871–1901 (1990) J R Aust Hist Soc, 76, pp. 45-61; Kingma, D., Ba, J.A., A method for stochastic optimization (2015) International Conference on Learning Representations; Klein, S., Kopel, M., (2002) A Voting System for Automatic Ocr Correction; Klein, G., Kim, Y., Deng, Y., Senellart, J., Rush, A., OpenNMT: Open-source toolkit for neural machine translation (2017) Proceedings of ACL 2017, System Demonstrations, pp. 67-72; Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation (2005) Proceedings of Machine Translation Summit, Pp 79–86; Koehn, P., Hoang, H., Birch, A., Callison-Burch, C., Federico, M., Bertoldi, N., Cowan, B., Herbst, E., Moses: Open source toolkit for statistical machine translation (2007) Proceedings of the 45Th Annual Meeting of the ACL on Interactive Poster and Demonstration Sessions, ACL ’07, pp. 177-180; Kolak, O., Resnik, P., OCR error correction using a noisy channel model (2002) Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Human Language Technology Research, pp. 257-262; Kolak, O., Byrne, W., Resnik P.

More specifically, digitized historical newspapers give us a magnifying glass into the past. In this paper, we propose a scalable and customizable big data analysis system that enables researchers to study complex questions about our society as depicted in news media for the past few centuries by applying cutting-edge text analysis tools to large historical newspaper collections. We discuss our experience with building a preliminary version of such a system, including how we have addressed the following challenges: processing millions of digitized newspaper pages from various publications worldwide, which amount to hundreds of terabytes of data; applying article segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to historical newspapers, which vary between and within publications over time; retrieving relevant information to answer research questions from such data collections by applying human-in-the-loop machine learning; and enabling users to analyze topic evolution and semantic dynamics with multiple compatible analysis operators. We also present some preliminary results of using the proposed system to study the social construction of juvenile delinquency in the United States and discuss important remaining challenges to be tackled in the future. © 2022 ACM.","big data analysis system; data visualization; historical newspapers; image analysis; information retrieval; juvenile delinquency; natural language processing; newspaper article segmentation; social construction; social science research; text analysis","Cutting tools; Data handling; Data visualization; Deep learning; Image segmentation; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Newsprint; Optical character recognition; Search engines; Semantics; Big data analyse system; Data analysis system; Historical newspapers; Image-analysis; Juvenile delinquency; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Newspaper article segmentation; Social constructions; Social science research; Text analysis; Big data",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: ACI-1445606, ACI-1548562; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, UIUC: 1725729","Due to the difference in licensing of the data collections we used, we downloaded and processed the data in two different computing environments.

Unfortunately, this broadly used technology is error-prone, especially when an OCRed document was written hundreds of years ago. Neural networks have shown great success in solving various text processing tasks, including OCR post-correction. The main disadvantage of using neural networks for historical corpora is the lack of sufficiently large training datasets they require to learn from, especially for morphologically rich languages like Hebrew. Moreover, it is not clear what are the optimal structure and values of hyperparameters (predefined parameters) of neural networks for OCR error correction in Hebrew due to its unique features. Furthermore, languages change across genres and periods. These changes may affect the accuracy of OCR post-correction neural network models. To overcome these challenges, we developed a new multi-phase method for generating artificial training datasets with OCR errors and hyperparameters' optimization for building an effective neural network for OCR post-correction in Hebrew. To evaluate the proposed approach, a series of experiments using several literary Hebrew corpora from various periods and genres were conducted. The obtained results demonstrate that (1) training a network on texts from a similar period dramatically improves the network's ability to fix OCR errors, (2) using the proposed error injection algorithm, based on character-level period-specific errors, minimizes the need for manually corrected data and improves the network accuracy by 9%, (3) the optimized network design improves the accuracy by 3% compared to the state-of-the-art network, and (4) the constructed optimized network outperforms neural machine translation models and industry-leading spellcheckers. The proposed methodology may have practical implications for digital humanities projects that aim to search and analyze OCRed documents in Hebrew and potentially other morphologically rich languages. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","dataset generation; digital humanities; DNN; Hebrew; historical newspapers; neural machine translation; OCR post-correction","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Error correction; Large dataset; Neural machine translation; Newsprint; Structural optimization; Character recognition errors; Dataset generation; Digital humanities; DNN; Errors correction; Hebrew; Historical newspapers; Neural-networks; Optical character recognition post-correction; Training dataset; Optical character recognition",,,,,,,,"Ali, A., Renals, S., Word error rate estimation for speech recognition: E-WER (2018) Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics., pp. 20-24; Amrhein, C., Clematide, S., Supervised OCR error detection and correction using statistical and neural machine translation methods (2018) J.

This paper introduces an ML challenge, named Challenging America (ChallAm), based on OCR-ed excerpts from historical newspapers collected from the Chronicling America portal. ChallAm provides a dataset of clippings, labeled with metadata on their origin, and paired with their textual contents retrieved by an OCR tool. Three, publicly available, ML tasks are defined in the challenge: to determine the article date, to detect the location of the issue, and to deduce a word in a text gap (cloze test). Strong baselines are provided for all three ChallAm tasks. In particular, we pretrained a RoBERTa model from scratch from the historical texts. We also discuss the issues of discrimination and hate-speech present in the historical American texts. © Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: NAACL 2022 - Findings.",,"Computational linguistics; Historical newspapers; Textual content; Time-scales; Transformer modeling; Modeling languages",,,,,,"This work was partially supported by the Cyfrowa",,"Aluru, Sai Saket, Mathew, Binny, Saha, Punyajoy, Mukherjee, Animesh, (2020) Deep learning models for multilingual hate speech detection, , ArXiv preprint, abs/2004.06465; Brown, Tom B., Mann, Benjamin, Ryder, Nick, Subbiah, Melanie, Kaplan, Jared, Dhariwal, Prafulla, Neelakantan, Arvind, Amodei, Dario, Language models are few-shot learners (2020) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2020, NeurIPS 2020, , December 6-12, 2020, virtual; Caselli, Tommaso, Basile, Valerio, Mitrovic, Jelena, Granitzer, Michael, HateBERT: Retraining BERT for abusive language detection in English (2021) Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms (WOAH 2021), pp. 17-25. , Online.

Such studies have either focused on the effects of artificially degraded OCR quality (see, e.g., [1-2]) or utilized test collections containing texts based on authentic low quality OCR data (see, e.g., [3]). In this paper the effects of OCR quality are studied in a user-oriented information retrieval setting. Thirty-two users evaluated subjectively query results of six topics each (out of 30 topics) based on pre-formulated queries using a simulated work task setting. To the best of our knowledge our simulated work task experiment is the first one showing empirically that users' subjective relevance assessments of retrieved documents are affected by a change in the quality of optically read text. Users of historical newspaper collections have so far commented effects of OCR'ed data quality mainly in impressionistic ways, and controlled user environments for studying effects of OCR quality on users' relevance assessments of the retrieval results have so far been missing. To remedy this The National Library of Finland (NLF) set up an experimental query environment for the contents of one Finnish historical newspaper, Uusi Suometar 1869-1918, to be able to compare users' evaluation of search results of two different OCR qualities for digitized newspaper articles. The query interface was able to present the same underlying document for the user based on two alternatives: either based on the lower OCR quality, or based on the higher OCR quality, and the choice was randomized. The users did not know about quality differences in the article texts they evaluated. The main result of the study is that improved optical character recognition quality affects perceived usefulness of historical newspaper articles significantly. The mean average evaluation score for the improved OCR results was 7.94% higher than the mean average evaluation score of the old OCR results. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","evaluation; historical newspapers; Interactive information search; OCR quality; query engine; simulated work task","Information retrieval; Newsprint; Quality control; Search engines; Evaluation; Historical newspapers; Interactive information search; Optical character recognition quality; Perceived usefulness; Query engines; Relevance assessments; Simulated work task; User study; Work task; Optical character recognition",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Academy of Finland, AKA; Tampereen Yliopisto, UTA: 326616; Horizon 2020: 770299","This work was part of the NewsEye project, which has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 770299.

Zoning document images such as digitized historical newspaper pages are challenging due to noise and quality of the document images. Recently, effective data-driven approaches, such as leveraging deep learning, have been proposed, albeit with the concern of requiring larger training data and thus incurring additional cost of ground truthing. We propose a zoning solution by incorporating a knowledge-driven document representation, gravity map, into a multimodal deep learning framework to reduce the amount of time and data required for training. We first generate a gravity map for each image, considering the centroid distance and area between a cell in a Voronoi tessellation and its content to encode visual domain knowledge of a zoning task. Second, we inject the gravity maps into a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) during training, as an additional modality to boost performance. We report on two investigations using two state-of-the-art DCNN architectures and three datasets: two sets of historical newspapers and a set of born-digital contemporary documents. Evaluations show that our solution achieved comparable segmentation accuracy using fewer training epochs and less training data compared to a naïve training scheme. © 2021 SPIE and IS&T.","document image processing; image analysis; image decomposition; image recognition; image segmentation","Deep learning; Domain Knowledge; Image recognition; Newsprint; Optical character recognition; Optical data processing; Zoning; Document image processing; Document images; Domain knowledge; Gravity maps; Historical newspapers; Image decomposition; Image-analysis; Images segmentations; Multi-modal; Training data; Image segmentation",,,,,"National Endowment for the Humanities, NEH; Institute of Museum and Library Services, IMLS","This project was supported in part by the Trans-Atlantic Partnership Digging into Data Challenge (U.S. funder Institute of Museum and Library Services, IMLS) and has received previous support from IMLS and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).

Recognition of such damages is currently absent in digitization-and-information-extraction (DIE) systems but crucial for automatic document comprehension and exploitation. In this paper we propose a generic damage recognition (DR) method based on a joint global and local modeling of the text homogeneity (TH) pattern exhibited in document images. More specifically, a connected component (CC) based formulation is developed as a global homogeneity measure, where TH is characterized using a probabilistic graph model for a coarse recognition of damaged regions. A multi-resolution analysis (MRA) of TH is further developed for a granular within-CC recognition of damage pixels, where the disparity between damage and text pixels is characterized by exploiting neighborhood transitions. This enables the formulation of a local homogeneity measure, where the neighborhood transition around an individual pixel is modeled using the propagation of the approximation coefficients of a stationary wavelet transform (SWT). The proposed global and local homogeneity measures are integrated as a joint likelihood in a Bayesian model with a Markov random field (MRF) prior, where DR is formulated as a maximum a posterior (MAP) inference which is addressed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The resulting algorithm is tested on a set of real-life historical newspaper images containing damages of varying size and shape. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using both F-measures and the Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metric, where test results demonstrate the promising potential of the proposed method. © 2021 The Author(s)","Bayesian inference; Damage recognition; Neighborhood transition; Propagation of wavelet approximation; Text homogeneity","Bayesian networks; Character recognition; Inference engines; Magnetorheological fluids; Markov processes; Structural frames; Wavelet transforms; Bayesian; Bayesian inference; Connected component; Damage recognition; Document images; Image-based; Neighborhood transition; Neighbourhood; Propagation of wavelet approximation; Text homogeneity; Pixels",,,,,"Belgian Federal Science Policy Office, BELSPO; Vlaamse regering","This research is supported by the Auditing Digitisation Outputs in the Cultural Heritage Sector (ADOCHS) project (Contract No. BR/154/A6/ADOCHS), financed by the Belgian Science Policy (Belspo) within the scope of the BRAIN programme and by funding from the Flemish Government under the “Onderzoeksprogramma Artificiële Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen” programme.",,"Papadopoulos, C., Pletschacher, S., Clausner, C., Antonacopoulos, A., The IMPACT dataset of historical document images (2013) Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Historical Document Imaging and Processing, pp. 123-130; Mandell, L.C., Neudecker, C., Antonacopoulos, A., Grumbach, E., Auvil, L., Christy, M.J., Heil, J.A., Samuelson, T., Navigating the storm: IMPACT, eMOP, and agile steering standards (2015) Digit.

The main goal of this competition is to automatically analyse the structure of historical newspaper pages with a subsequent evaluation of the participants’ algorithms performance. In contrast to many existing segmentation methods, instead of working on pixels, the present study has a focus on clustering baselines/text lines into text blocks. Therefore, we introduce a new measure based on a baseline detection evaluation scheme. But also common pixel-based approaches could participate without restrictions. Working on baseline level addresses directly the application scenario where for a given image the contained text should be extracted in blocks for further investigations. We present the results of three submissions.

It is bound up with the early modern period of history. Historical newspapers are of utmost importance to nations and its people, and researchers from different disciplines rely on these papers to improve our understanding of the past. In pursuit of satisfying this need, Istanbul University Head Office of Library and Documentation provides access to a big database of scanned historical newspapers. To take it another step further and make the documents more accessible, we need to run optical character recognition (OCR) and named entity recognition (NER) tasks on the whole database and index the results to allow for full-text search mechanism. We design and implement a system encompassing the whole pipeline starting from scrapping the dataset from the original website to providing a graphical user interface to run search queries, and it manages to do that successfully. Proposed system provides to search people, culture and security-related keywords and to visualise them. © The Author(s) 2021.","Data journalism; full-text search; historical newspapers; microservices; named entity recognition; optical character recognition; visualisation","Graphical user interfaces; Natural language processing systems; Office buildings; Optical character recognition; Design and implements; Full-text search; Historical newspapers; Istanbul; Named entity recognition; Optical character recognition (OCR); Search queries; Turkishs; Newsprint",,,,,,,,"Nadeau, D., Sekine, S., A survey of named entity recognition and classification (2007) Lingvisticae Investigat, 30 (1), pp. 3-26; Minkov, E., Wang, R.C., Cohen, W., Extracting personal names from email: applying named entity recognition to informal text, pp. 443-450. , Proceedings of human language technology conference and conference on empirical methods natural language processing, Vancouver, BC, Canada, 6–8 October 2005, Stroudsburg, PA, ACL, In; Tanabe, L., Xie, N., Thom, L.H., Genetag: a tagged corpus for gene/protein named entity recognition (2005) BMC Bioinformat, 6, p.

The subtasks we addressed in our submission include coarse-grained named entity recognition, entity mention detection and entity linking. For the task of named entity recognition we used an ensemble of fine-tuned BERT models; entity linking was approached by three different methods: (1) a simple method relying on ElasticSearch retrieval scores, (2) an approach based on contextualised text embeddings, and (3) REL, a modular entity linking system based on several state-of-the-art components.

This step is commonly referred to as page segmentation. While various rule-based algorithms have been proposed, the applicability of Deep Neural Networks for this task recently has gained a lot of attention. In this paper, we perform a systematic evaluation of 11 different published backbone architectures and 9 different tiling and scaling configurations for separating text, tables or table column lines. We also show the influence of the number of labels and the number of training pages on the segmentation quality, which we measure using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Our results show that (depending on the task) Inception-ResNetv2 and EfficientNet backbones work best, vertical tiling is generally preferable to other tiling approaches, and training data that comprises 30 to 40 pages will be sufficient most of the time. © 2020 IEEE","Image segmentation; Neural networks; Optical character recognition software","Network architecture; Newsprint; Optical character recognition; Correlation coefficient; Historical documents; Historical newspapers; Page segmentation; Rule based algorithms; Segmentation quality; Systematic evaluation; Training pages; Deep neural networks",,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: BU 3502/1-1","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the Deutsche Forschungs-gemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation), project number BU 3502/1-1.

Existing text segmentation methods have typically been developed and tested using clean, narrative-style text with segments containing distinct topics. Here we consider a challenging text segmentation task: dividing newspaper marriage announcement lists into units of one announcement each. In many cases the information is not structured into sentences, and adjacent segments are not topically distinct from each other. In addition, the text of the announcements, which is derived from images of historical newspapers via optical character recognition, contains many typographical errors. As a result, these announcements are not amenable to segmentation with existing techniques. We present a novel deep learning-based model for segmenting such text and show that it significantly outperforms an existing state-of-the-art method on our task. © 2020 IEEE","Deep learning; Document analysis; Information extraction; Natural language processing; Text mining; Text segmentation","Deep learning; Natural language processing systems; Optical character recognition; Historical newspapers; Learning Based Models; NAtural language processing; State-of-the-art methods; Text segmentation; Typographical errors; Newsprint",,,,,,,,"Beeferman, D., Berger, A., Lafferty, J., Statistical models for text segmentation (1999) Machine Learning, 34 (1-3), pp. 177-210; Webster, J.J., Kit, C., Tokenization as the initial phase in NLP (1992) Proc.

Evaluation results reported in the paper are based mainly on a 500 000 word sample of the Finnish language part of the whole collection. The sample has three different parallel parts: a manually corrected ground truth version, original OCR with ABBYY FineReader v. 7 or v. 8, and an ABBYY FineReader v. 11 re-OCRed version for comparison with Tesseract’s OCR. Using this sample and its page image originals we have developed a re-OCRing procedure using the open source software package Tesseract v. 3.04.01. Our method achieved initially 27.48% improvement vs. ABBYY FineReader 7 or 8 and 9.16% improvement vs. ABBYY FineReader 11 on document level. On word level our method achieved 36.25% improvement vs. ABBYY FineReader 7 or 8 and 20.14% improvement vs. ABBYY FineReader 11. Our final precision and recall results on word level show clear improvement in the quality: recall is 76.0 and precision 92.0 in comparison to GT OCR. Other measures, such as recognizability of words with a morphological analyzer and character accuracy rate, show also steady improvement after re-OCRing. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Evaluation; Finnish; Historical newspaper collections; Optical character recognition","Linguistics; Newsprint; Open systems; Optical character recognition; Accuracy rate; Evaluation results; Ground truth; Morphological analyzer; National libraries; Open sources; Optical character recognition (OCR); Precision and recall; Open source software",,,,,"European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Acknowledgements.

If this represents a huge step forward in terms of preservation and accessibility, the next fundamental challenge- and real promise of digitization- is to exploit the contents of these digital assets, and therefore to adapt and develop appropriate language technologies to search and retrieve information from this 'Big Data of the Past'. Yet, the application of text processing tools on historical documents in general, and historical newspapers in particular, poses new challenges, and crucially requires appropriate language resources. In this context, this paper presents a collection of historical newspaper data sets composed of text and image resources, curated and published within the context of the 'impresso - Media Monitoring of the Past' project. With corpora, benchmarks, semantic annotations and language models in French, German and Luxembourgish covering ca. 200 years, the objective of the impresso resource collection is to contribute to historical language resources, and thereby strengthen the robustness of approaches to non-standard inputs and foster efficient processing of historical documents. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC","Digital humanities; Historical and multilingual language resources; Historical texts; Multi-layered historical semantic annotations; Named entity processing; OCR; Text reuse; Topic modeling","Historic preservation; Semantics; Text processing; Cultural heritages; Historical documents; Historical newspapers; Language resources; Language technology; Media monitoring; Resource collections; Semantic annotations; Newsprint",,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF: CR-SII5 173719","We warmly thank the impressoteam as well as student collaborators Camille Watter, Stefan Bircher, Julien Nguyen Dang for their annotation work.

In order to address these challenges, we have developed an end-to-end OCR pipeline named Origami. This pipeline is part of a current project on the digitization and quantitative analysis of the German newspaper ""Berliner Börsen-Zeitung""(BBZ), from 1872 to 1931. The Origami pipeline reuses existing open source OCR components and on top offers a new configurable architecture for layout detection, a simple table recognition, a two-stage X-Y cut for reading order detection, and a new robust implementation for document dewarping. In this paper we describe the different stages of the workflow and discuss how they meet the above-mentioned challenges posed by historical newspapers. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Deep neural networks; End-to-end OCR; Historical newspapers; Layout detection","Humanities computing; Metadata; Newsprint; Configurable architectures; Current projects; Different stages; Digital humanities; German newspapers; Historical newspapers; Order detections; Readable data; Pipelines",,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: BU 3502/1-1","This research was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation), project number BU 3502/1-1.",,"Aichholzer, O., A Novel Type of Skeleton for Polygons (1995) J.

This collection contains approximately 1.95 million pages in Finnish and Swedish. The Finnish part of the collection consists of about 2.40 billion words. The National Library’s Digital Collections are offered via the digi.kansalliskirjasto.fi web service, also known as Digi. An open data package of the whole collection was released in early 2017 (Pääkkönen et al. 2016). Quality of OCRed collections is an important topic in digital humanities, as it affects general usability and searchability of collections. There is no single available method to assess quality of large collections, but different methods can be used to approximate quality. This paper discusses different corpus analysis style methods to approximate overall lexical quality of the Finnish part of the Digi collection. Methods include usage of parallel samples and word error rates, usage of morphological analysers, frequency analysis of words and comparisons to comparable edited lexical data. Our aim in the quality analysis is twofold: firstly to analyse the present state of the lexical data and secondly, to establish a set of assessment methods that build up a compact procedure for quality assessment after e.g. re-OCRing or post-correction of the material. © 2020 The Author(s).","19th century Finnish newspaper collection; Lexical quality estimation; OCR quality",,,,,,"European Commission, EC; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This work is supported by European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Leverage from the EU, 2014–2020.","This work is supported by European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Leverage","Baayen, R.

Named entities are one of the main entry points used to search and retrieve digital documents. However, most digitized documents are indexed through their OCRed version and OCR errors may hinder their accessibility. This paper aims to quantitatively estimate the impact of OCR quality on the performance of named entity recognition (NER). We tested state-of-the-art NER techniques over several evaluation benchmarks, and experimented with various levels and types of synthesised OCR noise so as to estimate the impact of OCR noise on NER performance. We share all corresponding datasets. To the best of our knowledge, no other research work has systematically studied the impact of OCR on named entity recognition over datasets in multiple languages. The final outcome of this study is an evaluation over historical newspaper data of the national library of Finland, resulting in an increase of around 11% points in terms of F1-measure over the best-known results to this day. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Digitized documents; Indexing; Named entity recognition; OCR","Benchmarking; Natural language processing systems; Digital Documents; Entry point; Historical newspapers; Multiple languages; Named entities; Named entity recognition; National libraries; State of the art; Digital libraries",,,,,"Horizon 2020: 770299","This work has been supported by the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant 770299 (NewsEye).",,"Bikel, D.M., Schwartz, R., Weischedel, R.M., An algorithm that learns what’s in a name (1999) Mach.

We converted an image of the text block on an entire newspaper page into a sequence of codes based on discretization of the feature vectors, an approach that eliminated the errors introduced by optical character recognition (OCR). This conversion makes it possible to analyze untranscribed newspaper images by using text-processing methods. We examined the daily occurrence of every tri-gram string, and extracted strings with a dense appearance as distinctive keywords. In addition, we highlighted articles that contain distinctive keywords as distinctive articles. The proposed method was evaluated on an archive of Japanese newspaper images published in the 19th century, and the results were promising. © 2020 SPIE CCC.","Historical documents; Historical newspapers; Keyword extraction","Imaging techniques; Optical character recognition; Text processing; 19th century; Discretizations; Feature vectors; Historical newspapers; Optical character recognition (OCR); Tri grams; Newsprint",,,,,,,,"Manmatha, R., Han, C., Riseman, E.M., Word spotting: A new approach to indexing handwriting (1996) Proc. 1996 IEEE Computer Society Conf.

NER has been applied to many types of texts and different types of entities: newspapers, fiction, historical records, persons, locations, chemical compounds, protein families, animals etc. Performance of a NER system is usually quite heavily genre and domain dependent. Entity categories used in NER may also vary. The most used set of named entity categories is usually some version of three partite categorization of locations, persons, and organizations. In this paper we report evaluation results with data extracted from a digitized Finnish historical newspaper collection Digi using two statistical NER systems, namely, Stanford Named Entity Recognizer and LSTM-CRF NER model. The OCRed newspaper collection has lots of OCR errors; its estimated word level correctness is about 70–75%. Our NER evaluation collection and training data are based on ca. 500 000 words which have been manually corrected from OCR output of ABBYY FineReader 11. We have also available evaluation data of new uncorrected OCR output of Tesseract 3.04.01. Our Stanford NER results are mostly satisfactory. With our ground truth data we achieve F-score of 0.89 with locations and 0.84 with persons. With organizations the result is 0.60. With re-OCRed Tesseract output the results are 0.79, 0.72, and 0.42, respectively. Results of LSTM-CRF are similar. Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

Based on the research conducted on the platform AustriaN Newspapers Online (ANNO) for the NewsEye case study ‘the dark sides of war’, the main challenges of working with digitized newspaper collections will be discussed in this paper. Especially two aspects – the fire catastrophe at the munitions factory Wöllersdorf (1918/09/18) in Lower Austria and the Austrian press coverage about war widows during the First World War – will be used as specific examples. The discussed limitations include the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) quality, provided search options and metadata, as well as others. Furthermore, possible improvements regarding these challenges, e.g. Optical Layout Recognition (OLR), Named-entity Recognition (NER) and Named-entity Linking (NEL), will be presented in this paper.

This can be problematic if the post-correction method was trained on a specific OCR system but have to be applied on the result of another system. Whereas OCR post-correction of historical text has received much attention lately, the question of what role does the OCR system play for the post-correction method has not been addressed. In this study we explore a dataset of 400 documents of historical Swedish text which has been OCR processed by three state-of-the-art OCR systems: Abbyy Finereader, Tesseract and Ocropus. We examine the OCR results of each system and present a supervised machine learning post-correction method that tries to approach the challenges exhibited by each system. We study the performance of our method by using three evaluation tools: PrimA, Språkbanken evaluation tool and Frontiers Toolkit. Based on the evaluation analysis we discuss the impact each of the OCR systems has on the results of the post-correction method. We report on quantitative and qualitative results showing varying degrees of OCR post-processing complexity that are important to consider when developing an OCR post-correction method.

As one type of social reality, juvenile delinquency is perceived as part of social problems, deeply contextualized and socially constructed in American society. The social construction of juvenile delinquency started far earlier than the first juvenile court in 1899 in the U.S. Scholars have tried traditional historical analysis to explore the timeline of the social construction of juvenile delinquency in the past, but it is inefficient to examine hundred years of documents using traditional paper-pencil documenting method. We propose to research, develop and apply image and text analysis methods to analyze hundreds of years of newspaper data and show a clear development of social construction of juvenile delinquency in American society. The project aims to explore questions around how the media started depicting certain types of juvenile behavior as delinquency, how they described those behaviors; who are those juveniles (age, race, gender, family background, community background, etc.), how other social institutions treat those juveniles in those stories; how the depiction of juvenile delinquency has changed during the past 100 years; whether the analysis results support social construction perspective in terms of juvenile delinquency or not. In this paper, we present our ongoing work of doing image analysis on the newspaper collection from the Library of Congress Chronicling America website, initial results, observations, current conclusions, and future work. © 2019 IEEE.","Digitized data; Historical newspaper collections; Image analysis; Juvenile delinquency; Newspaper article segmentation; Optical character recognition; Social construction; Text analysis","Big data; e-Science; Newsprint; Historical analysis; Library of congress; Social constructions; Social problems; Social reality; Text-analysis methods; Image analysis",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: ACI-1445606, ACI-1548562","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work used the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), which is supported by National Science Foundation grant number ACI-1548562.

The specific focus is on a study about historical process of commodification. The named entity detection pipeline is discussed in three steps. First, the paper presents the corpus, which consists of newspaper articles on wild berry picking from the late nineteenth century. Second, the paper compares two named entity recognition tools: the trainable Stanford NER and the rule-based FiNER. Third, the linking and disambiguation of the recognized places is explored. In the linking process, information about the newspaper publication place is used to improve the identification of small places. The paper concludes that the pipeline performs well for mapping the commodification, and that specific problems relate to the recognition of place names (among named entities). It is shown how Stanford NER performs better in the task (F-score of 0.83) than the FiNER tool (F-score of 0.68). Concerning the linking of places, the use of newspaper metadata appears useful for disambiguation between small places. However, the historical language (with its OCR errors) recognized by the Stanford model poses challenges for the linking tool. The paper proposes that other information, for instance about the reuse of the newspaper articles, could be used to further improve the recognition and linking quality. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

Work and results reported in the paper are based on a 500 000 word ground truth (GT) sample of the Finnish language part of the whole collection. The sample has three different parallel parts: a manually corrected ground truth version, original OCR with ABBYY FineReader v. 7 or v. 8, and an ABBYY FineReader v. 11 re-OCRed version. Based on this sample and its page image originals we have developed a re-OCRing process using the open source software package Tesseract1 v. 3.04.01. Our methods in the re-OCR include image preprocessing techniques, usage of morphological analyzers and a set of weighting rules for resulting candidate words. Besides results based on the GT sample we present also results of re-OCR for a 29 year period of one newspaper of our collection, Uusi Suometar.

A sequence-to-sequence model with attention is applied for single-input correction, and a new decoder with multi-input attention averaging is developed to search for consensus among multiple sequences. We design two ways of training the correction model without human annotation, either training to match noisily observed textual variants or bootstrapping from a uniform error model. On two corpora of historical newspapers and books, we show that these unsupervised techniques cut the character and word error rates nearly in half on single inputs and, with the addition of multi-input decoding, can rival supervised methods. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Computational linguistics; Correction models; Historical newspapers; Human annotations; Multiple sequences; Sequence modeling; Supervised methods; Unsupervised techniques; Unsupervised training; Decoding",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: 2R01DC009834-06A1; Andrew W.

For example, recipes published in newspapers highlight what and how we ate and thought about food. The challenge here is that newspaper data is often unstructured and highly varied. Digitised historical newspapers add an additional challenge, namely that of fluctuations in OCR quality. Therefore, it is difficult to locate and extract recipes from them. We present our approach based on distant supervision and automatically extracted lexicons to identify recipes in digitised historical newspapers, to generate recipe tags, and to extract ingredient information. We provide OCR quality indicators and their impact on the extraction process. We enrich the recipes with links to information on the ingredients. Our research shows how natural language processing, machine learning, and semantic web can be combined to construct a rich dataset from heterogeneous newspapers for the historical analysis of food culture. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Digital humanities; Digitised newspapers; Food history; Information extraction; Natural language processing","Artificial intelligence; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Newsprint; Digital humanities; Digitised newspapers; Extraction process; Historical analysis; Historical newspapers; Quality indicators; Recipe tags; Semantic Web",,,,,,,,"Otterloo, A.H., (1990) Eten En Eetlust in Nederland, 1840–1990: Een Historisch-Sociologische Studie, , B.

The aim of the project was to improve the main segments of digitization that were developed properly and to apply new digitization methods in as many institutions as possible in Serbia in a standardized way. The new digitization methods and approaches used in this project mostly come from the cooperation of the University Library “Svetozar Markovic” with leading world institutions or result from the in-house development of digital tools to improve segments of the digitization process. During 2016, the University Library “Svetozar Markovic” in cooperation with the British National Library carried out the project entitled “Safeguarding the fragile collection of the private archive of the Lazic family” within which it acquired rich experience in enhancing the digitization process. This paper presents several segments which show how the digitization process has been improved within the project. The paper also outlines the need for the full searchability of digital text in materials that are presented to patrons and that portray the University Library “Svetozar Markovic” experience through the example of a searchable collection of historical newspapers. Two methods for creating searchable texts are outlined: via the creation of METS-ALTO files in cooperation with the National Library of Luxembourg in the case of printed materials and via automatic recognition of the handwritten text in the Horizon 2020 READ project. Finally, the needs of patron groups in working with digital materials and possibilities for their display and promotion in the modern business environment of libraries are analyzed. This paper describes in detail the experience of using the promotional device Magic Box at the University Library “Svetozar Markovic” and outlines analysis and scenarios for its application in cultural institutions. This paper is an overview of the possibilities and first experiences of improving the digitization process which will mark the following development of the field in Serbia and the region. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Digital tools; Digitization process; University library “svetozar markovic”","Character recognition; Digital devices; Libraries; Automatic recognition; Business environments; Cultural institutions; Digital tools; Historical newspapers; In-house development; Partner institutions; University libraries; Digital libraries",,,,,,"The University Library “Svetozar Markovic” consolidated its digitization activities in the project entitled “New Horizons of Digitization in Serbia”, carried out with eight partner institutions (National Library of Serbia, Military Archives, University Library Kragujevac, Biblical Institute of the Faculty of Orthodox Theology (University of Belgrade), City Library Novi Sad, Library “Milutin Bojic”, Journalists’ Association of Serbia and BITEF).

This approach is orthogonal to, and may be combined with, previously proposed methods for combining the output of different OCR systems on the same image or the output of the same OCR system on differently processed images of the same text. It may also be combined with methods to estimate the parameters of a noisy channel model of OCR errors. Additionally, the current method generalizes previous proposals for a simple majority- vote combination of known duplicated texts. On a corpus of historical newspapers, an annotated set of clusters has a baseline word error rate (WER) of 33%. A majority vote procedure reaches 23% on passages where one or more duplicates were found, and consensus decoding combined with a language model achieves 18% WER. In a separate experiment, newspapers were aligned to very widely reprinted texts such as State of the Union speeches, producing clusters with up to 58 witnesses. Beyond 20 witnesses, majority vote outperforms language model rescoring, though the gap between them is much less in this experiment. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Character recognition; Computational linguistics; Decoding; Newsprint; Optical character recognition; Speech recognition; Historical newspapers; Language model; Majority vote; Noisy channel models; Optical character recognition (OCR); Processed images; Simple majority; Word error rate; Digital libraries",,,,,"National Institutes of Health: 2R01DC009834-06A1; Andrew W.

Our new evaluated tool for NER tagging is non-conventional: it is a rule-based Finnish Semantic Tagger, the FST (Löfberg et al., 2005), and its results are compared to those of a standard rule-based NE tagger, FiNER. © 2017 Linköping University Electronic Press.",,"Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; 19th century; Entity search; Entity tagging; Finnish; Historical newspapers; Named entities; Named entity recognition; Rule based; Semantic tags; Textual data; Newsprint",,,,,"European Commission, EC; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","Work of the first author is funded by the EU Commission through its European Regional Development Fund, and the program Leverage from the EU 2014–2020.",,"Ehrmann, Maud, Colavizz, Giovanni, Rochat, Yannick, Kaplan, Frédéric, Diachronic Evaluation of NER Systems on Old Newspapers (2016) Proceedings of the 13th Conference on Natural Language Processing (KONVENS 2016), pp. 97-107. , https://www.linguistics.rub.de/konvens16/pub/13_konvensproc.pdf; Hirst, Graeme, (2009) Ontology and the Lexicon, , ftp://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/gh/Hirst-Ontol2009.pdf; Kettunen, Kimmo, Pääkkönen, Tuula, Measuring Lexical Quality of a Historical Finnish Newspaper Collection – Analysis of Garbled OCR Data with Basic Language Technology Tools and Means (2016) LREC 2016, Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, , http://www.lrecconf.org/proceedings/lrec2016/pdf/17_Paper.pdf; Kettunen, Kimmo, Mäkelä, Eetu, Kuokkala, Juha, Ruokolainen, Teemu, Niemi, Jyrki, Modern Tools for Old Content - in Search of Named Entities in a Finnish OCRed Historical Newspaper Collection 1771-1910 (2016) Proceedings of Conference ""Lernen, Wissen, Daten, Analysen"", LWDA 2016, , http://ceurws.org/Vol-1670/, Krestel, R., Mottin, D. and Müller, E.

First, approximate string matching methods were used to generate lists of index words most similar to contemporary query terms in a digitized newspaper collection from the 1800s. Top index word variants were categorized to estimate the appropriate query expansion ranges in the retrieval test. Second, the effectiveness of approximate string matching methods, automatically generated inflectional forms, and their combinations were measured in a Cranfield-style test. Finally, a detailed topic-level analysis of test results was conducted. In the index of historical newspaper collection the occurrences of a word typically spread to many linguistic and historical variants along with optical character recognition (OCR) errors. All query expansion methods improved the baseline results. Extensive expansion of around 30 variants for each query word was required to achieve the highest performance improvement. Query expansion based on approximate string matching was superior to using the inflectional forms of the query words, showing that coverage of the different types of variation is more important than precision in handling one type of variation. © 2015 ASIS&T","information retrieval; query expansion; query processing","Character recognition; Information retrieval; Newsprint; Optical character recognition; Query processing; Approximate string matching; Automatically generated; Baseline results; Historical newspapers; Optical character recognition (OCR); Query expansion; Query terms; Query words; Automatic test pattern generation; error; human; human experiment; information retrieval; language; publication; recognition",,,,,,,,"Airio, E., Kettunen, K., Does dictionary based bilingual retrieval work in a non-normalized index?

The premise of this paper is that, as an alternative, quality prediction may be used to approximate the success of a given OCR workflow. A new system is thus presented where a classifier is trained using metadata, image and layout features in combination with measured success rates (based on minimal ground truth). Subsequently, only document images are required as input for the numeric prediction of the quality score (no ground truth required). This way, the system can be applied to any number of similar (unseen) documents in order to assess their suitability for being processed using the particular workflow. The usefulness of the system has been validated using a realistic dataset of historical newspaper pages. © 2016 IEEE.","Digitisation; Document analysis; Ground truthing; Large-scale; Numeric prediction; Performance evaluation; Quality prediction; Supervised learning","Forecasting; Supervised learning; Digitisation; Document analysis; Ground truthing; Large-scale; Performance evaluation; Quality prediction; Quality control",,,,,,,,"http//www.europeananewspapers.eu/, Europeana Newspapers Project (ENP); Blando, L.R., Kanai, J., Nartker, T.A., Prediction of OCR accuracy using simple image features (1995) Proc.

Within three years, the project processed more than 10 million pages of historical newspapers from 12 national and major libraries to produce the largest open access and fully searchable text collection of digital historical newspapers in Europe. In this, a wide variety of legal, logistical, technical and other challenges were encountered. After introducing the background issues in newspaper digitization in Europe, the paper discusses the technical aspects of refinement in greater detail. It explains what decisions were taken in the design of the large-scale processing workflow to address these challenges, what were the results produced and what were identified as best practices. © 2016 IEEE.","digital libraries; historical newspapers; large-scale digitisation; layout analysis; optical character recognition","Character recognition; Digital libraries; Newsprint; Optical character recognition; Best practices; Digitisation; Historical newspapers; Large-scale processing; Layout analysis; Open Access; Technical aspects; Text collection; Electronic publishing",,,,,,,,"http//www.europeananewspapers.eu/, Europeana Newspapers Project; http//www.enumerate.eu/, Project ENUMERATE; http//www.europeana.eu/portal/, Europeana; http//www.loc.gov/standards/mets/, Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard; http//www.loc.gov/standards/alto/, Analyzed Layout and Text Object; http//www.europeana-newspapers.eu/wpcontent/uploads/2015/05/ENP-Deliverable_4.1_final.pdf, Europeana Newspapers Survey Report; Dunning, A., Neudecker, C., Representation and absence in digital resources: The case of europeana newspapers (2014) Presented at Digital Humanities 2014, , http//dharchive.org/paper/DH2014/Paper-773.xml, Lausanne, Switzerland, 7-12 July; Gatos, B., Pratikakis, I., Perantonis, S.J., Adaptive degraded document image binarisation (2006) Pattern Recognition, 39 (3), pp. 317-327. , March; Pletschacher, S., Clausner, C., Antonacopoulos, A., Europeana newspapers ocr workflow evaluation (2015) Proc 2015 Workshop on Historical Document Imaging and Processing (HIP2015), pp. 39-46. , Nancy, France; http//iipimage.sourceforge.net/, IIPImage server; http//iiif.io/, International Image Interoperability Framework; http//kakadusoftware.com/, Kakadu JPEG2000 software development kit; https//abbyy.technology/en:products:fre:start, ABBYY FineReader Engine; http//contentconversion.com/#docworks-2, Content Conversion Specialists docWorks; Hebert, D., Palfray, T., Nicolas, S., Tranouez, P., Paquet, T., Automatic article extraction in old newspapers digitized collections Proc First International Conference on Digital Access to Textual Cultural Heritage (DATeCH 2014), pp. 3-8. , ACM, New York, NY, USA; Antonacopoulos, A., Clausner, C., Papadopoulos, C., Pletschacher, S., ICDAR2013 Competition on historical newspaper layout analysis-hnla2013 (2013) Proc 12th Int Conf on Doc Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR2013), pp. 1486-1490. , Washington DC, USA; Neudecker, C., Wilms, L., Faber, W.J., Van Veen, T., Largescale refinement of digital historic newspapers with named entity recognition (2014) Proc IFLA Newspapers/GENLOC Pre-Conference Satellite Meeting, , Geneva, Switzerland, 13-14 August; Finkel, J.R., Grenager, T., Manning, C., Incorporating non-local information into information extraction systems by gibbs sampling Proc 43rd Annual Meeting of the Assoc for Comput Linguistics (ACL 2005), pp. 363-370. , http//nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/papers/gibbscrf3.pdf; Gooding, P., Exploring usage of digital newspaper archives through web log analysis: A case study of welsh newspapers online (2014) Presented at Digital Humanities 2014, , http//dharchive.org/paper/DH2014/Paper-310.xml, Lausanne, Switzerland, 7-12 July; http//www.europeana-newspapers.eu/wpcontent/uploads/2015/05/D3.5_Performance_Evaluation_Report_1.0.pdf, Europeana Newspapers Performance Evaluation Report; http//www.europeana-newspapers.eu/wpcontent/uploads/2015/05/D5.3_Final_release_ENMAP_1.0.pdf, Europeana Newspapers METS/ALTO Profile (ENMAP); http//www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers, The European Library Historic Newspapers; Clausner, C., Papadopoulos, C., Pletschacher, S., Antonacopoulos, A., The ENP image and ground truth dataset of historical newspapers (2015) Proc 13th Int Conf on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR2015), pp. 931-935. , Nancy, France; http//research.europeana.eu/itemtype/newspapers, Europeana Research; https//github.com/EuropeanaNewspapers, Europeana Newspapers GitHub; http//europeananewspapers.github.io/, Europeana Newspapers Final Report",,,"ABBYY;et al.;Family Search;HP;IAPR;iTESOFT","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","12th IAPR International Workshop on Document Analysis Systems, DAS 2016","11 April 2016 through 14 April 2016",,122291,,9781509017928,,,"English","Proc. - IAPR Int.

Part of this material is also available freely downloadable in The Language Bank of Finland provided by the Fin-CLARIN consortium. The collection can also be accessed through the Korp environment that has been developed by Språkbanken at the University of Gothenburg and extended by FIN-CLARIN team at the University of Helsinki to provide concordances of text resources. A Cranfield-style information retrieval test collection has been produced out of a small part of the Digi newspaper material at the University of Tampere (Järvelin et al., 2015). The quality of the OCRed collections is an important topic in digital humanities, as it affects general usability and searchability of collections. There is no single available method to assess the quality of large collections, but different methods can be used to approximate the quality. This paper discusses different corpus analysis style ways to approximate the overall lexical quality of the Finnish part of the Digi collection.","Finnish; Historical newspaper collections; Ocr evaluation","Digital libraries; Fins (heat exchange); Newsprint; Web services; Digital collections; Digital humanities; Finnish; Historical newspapers; Language technology; Lexical qualities; National libraries; University of helsinki; Quality control",,,,,"European Commission, EC; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","First author is funded by the EU Commission through its","European Regional Development Fund and the program","Alex, B., Burns, J., Estimating and rating the quality of optically character recognized text (2014) DATeCH'14 Proceedings of the First International Conference on Digital Access to Textual Cultural Heritage, pp. 97-102. , http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2595214; Baayen, H., (2001) Word Frequency Distributions, , Kluwer Academic Publishers; Bremer-Laamanen, M.-L., A nordic digital newspaper library (2001) International Preservation News, 26, pp. 18-20; Furrer, L., Volk, M., Reducing OCR errors in gothic-script documents (2011) Proceedings of Language Technologies for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage Workshop, pp. 97-103. , http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W11-4115, Hissar, Bulgaria, pp. 97-103; Holley, R., How good can it get?

NER has been applied to many types of texts and different types of entities: newspapers, fiction, historical records, persons, locations, chemical compounds, protein families, animals etc. In general a NER system's performance is genre and domain dependent and also used entity categories vary [1]. The most general set of named entities is usually some version of three partite categorization of locations, persons and organizations. In this paper we report first trials and evaluation of NER with data out of a digitized Finnish historical newspaper collection Digi. Digi collection contains 1,960,921 pages of newspaper material from years 1771-1910 both in Finnish and Swedish. We use only material of Finnish documents in our evaluation. The OCRed newspaper collection has lots of OCR errors; its estimated word level correctness is about 74-75 % [2]. Our principal NER tagger is a rule-based tagger of Finnish, FiNER, provided by the FIN-CLARIN consortium. We show also results of limited category semantic tagging with tools of the Semantic Computing Research Group (SeCo) of the Aalto University. FiNER is able to achieve up to 60.0 F-score with named entities in the evaluation data. Seco's tools achieve 30.0-60.0 F-score with locations and persons. Performance of FiNER and SeCo's tools with the data shows that at best about half of named entities can be recognized even in a quite erroneous OCRed text.

As a result of the interest we have lots of digital historical document collections available and will have more of them in the future. The National Library of Finland has digitized a large proportion of the historical newspapers published in Finland between 1771 and 1910 [1–3]; the collection, Digi, can be reached at http://digi.kansalliskirjasto.fi/. This collection contains approximately 1.95 million pages in Finnish and Swedish, the Finnish part being about 2.385 billion words. In the output of the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process, errors are common especially when the texts are printed in the Gothic (Fraktur, blackletter) typeface. The errors lower the usability of the corpus both from the point of view of human users as well as considering possible elaborated text mining applications. Automatic spell checking and correction of the data is also difficult due to the historical spelling variants and low OCR quality level of the material. This paper discusses the overall situation of the intended post-correction of the Digi content and evaluation of the correction. We shall present results of our post-correction trials, and discuss some aspects of methodology of evaluation. These are the first reported evaluation results of post-correction of the data and the experiences will be used in planning of the post-correction of the whole material. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Evaluation; Historical newspaper collections; OCR post-correction","Character recognition; Data mining; Newsprint; Optical character recognition; Digital humanities; Evaluation; Evaluation results; Historical documents; Historical newspapers; National libraries; Optical character recognition (OCR); Spell-checking; Digital libraries",,,,,"European Commission, EC; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This research was funded by the EU Commission through its European Regional Development Fund, and the program Leverage from the EU 2007–2013.",,"Bremer-Laamanen, M.-L., A Nordic digital newspaper library (2001) Int.

In order to disclose the large Czech Radio audio archive to research community and to public, we have been developing a system whose aim is to transcribe automatically the archive files, index them and make them searchable. The transcription of contemporary (1 or 2 decades old) documents is based on the lexicon and statistical language model (LM) built from a large amount of recent texts available in electronic form. From the older periods (before 1990), however, digital texts do not exist. Therefore, we needed a) to find resources that represent language of those times, b) to convert them from their original form to text, c) to utilize this text for creating epoch specific lexicons and LMs, and eventually, d) to apply them in the developed speech recognition system. In our case, the main resources included: scanned historical newspapers, shorthand notes from the national parliament and subtitles from retro TV programs. When converted into text, they allowed us to built a more appropriate lexicon and to produce a preliminary version of the transcriptions. These were reused for unsupervised retraining of the final LM. In this way, we significantly improved the accuracy of the automatically transcribed radio news broadcast in 1969-1989 era, from initial 83 % to 88 %. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","historical audio archives; lexicon building; machine learning; OCR; speech-to-text transcription","Audio archives; Automatic transcription; Cultural heritages; Historical newspapers; Multimedia resources; Research communities; Speech recognition systems; Statistical language modeling; C (programming language); Image analysis; Learning systems; Multimedia systems; Natural language processing systems; Optical character recognition; Speech recognition; Transcription",,,,,,,,"Hansen, J.H.L., Huang, R., Zhou, B., Seadle, M., Deller, J.R., Gurijala, A.R., Kurimo, M., Angkititrakul, P., SpeechFind: Advances in Spoken Document Retrieval for a National Gallery of the Spoken Word (2005) IEEE Trans. on Speech and Audio Processing, 13 (5), pp. 712-730; Ordelman, R.J.F., De Jong, F.M.G., Huijbregts, M.A.H., Van Leeuwen, D.A., Robust audio indexing for Dutch spoken-word collections (2005) 16th Int.

This platform has been designed to provide a user experience as intuitive as possible by using mature open source tools. All the features are implemented thanks to the Spring framework. To meet this goal, we created a system to display tiled high-resolution images operating without a plug-in but based on an open source solution called IIPImage. The platform also allows for full-text searches thanks to the Java search library Apache Lucene and displays the results in the form of newspaper articles. In addition, we established collaborative features to provide the users with the ability to correct the content automatically generated by our document processing workflow and accessed through the browsing platform. The system is able to store all the corrections of the users, by using the couple Hibernate/MySQL. The aim is to enable continuous improvement of both the content quality and the search accuracy, by exploiting the ability of the users to recognize significant errors, in order to enhance the digital objects representing the newspaper issues. The proposed system is designed to generate metadata describing the physical layout, but also the logical structure of newspaper documents. Our article segmentation analyses a newspaper issue and recognizes articles, even if they straddle more than one page or if they spread in a complex structure. The workflow can also consider as input data, the results of optical character recognition (OCR) engines in order to provide a textual indexation of the segmented articles. By using this system, we want to create a true and representative digital object using standard formats (i.e. METS / ALTO) and containing the logical description of the content, making easier reading and understanding by the users. ©2012 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.",,"Automatically generated; Continuous improvements; Document-processing; High resolution image; Historical newspapers; Open-source solutions; Optical character recognition engines; Segmentation analysis; Imaging techniques; Metadata; Newsprint; Optical character recognition; Societies and institutions; Open systems",,,,,,,,"Pitzalis, D., Pillay, R., Lahanier, C., A new Concept in high Resolution Internet Image Browsing 10th International Conference on Electronic Publishing (ELPUB), 2006; Holley, R., Many Hands Make Light Work: Public Collaborative OCR Text Correction in Australian Historic Newspapers (2009) National Library of Australia Staff Papers; Chrons, O., Sundell, S., Digitalkoot: Making Old Archives Accessible Using Crowdsourcing Workshops at the Twenty-Fifth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2011; Chang, F., Chen, C., Lu, C., A linear-time component- labeling algorithm using contour tracing technique (2004) Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 93 (2), pp. 206-220; Sauvola, J., Pietikainen, M., Adaptive document image binarization (2000) Pattern Recognition, 33 (2), pp. 225-236; Shafait, F., Keysers, D., Breuel, T., Efficient implementa- tion of local adaptive thresholding techniques using integral images (2008) Document Recognition and Retrieval XV, 6815 (1), p. 681510; Gatos, B., Ntirogiannis, K., Pratikakis, I., Icdar 2009 doc- ument image binarization contest (dibco 2009) (2009) Document Analysis and Recognition, 2009.

If some variables can be identified with near certainty, they can be conditioned upon, allowing further inference to be done efficiently. Specifically, we consider optical character recognition (OCR) systems that can be bootstrapped by identifying a subset of correctly translated document words with very high precision. This ""clean set"" is subsequently used as document-specific training data. While OCR systems produce confidence measures for the identity of each letter or word, thresholding these values still produces a significant number of errors. We introduce a novel technique for identifying a set of correct words with very high precision. Rather than estimating posterior probabilities, we bound the probability that any given word is incorrect using an approximate worst case analysis. We give empirical results on a data set of difficult historical newspaper scans, demonstrating that our method for identifying correct words makes only two errors in 56 documents. Using document-specific character models generated from this data, we are able to reduce the error over properly segmented characters by 34.1% from an initial OCR system's translation.1 © 2012 Gary B.

Since historical newspapers differ from recent newspapers in image quality, type fonts and language usages, optical character recognition (OCR) does not provide sufficient quality. Instead of OCR approach, we adopted appearance-based approach, that means we matched character to character with its shapes. Assuming proper character segmentation and proper feature description, full-text search problem is reduced to sequence matching problem of feature vector. To increase computational efficiency, we adopted pseudo-code expression called LSPC, which is a compact sketch of feature vector while retaining a good deal of its information. Experimental result showed that our method can retrieve a query string from a text of over eight million characters within a second. In addition, we predict that more sophisticated algorithm could be designed for LSPC. As an example, we established the Extended Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm that can reduce the computational cost further especially when the query string becomes longer. © 2011 IEEE.","Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm; historical document images; Locality-Sensitive Pseudo-Code; string matching; word spotting","Appearance based; Character segmentation; Computational costs; Feature description; Feature vectors; Full-text search; Historical documents; Historical newspapers; Pseudo-code; Query string; Sequence matching; String matching; Word Spotting; Algorithms; Codes (symbols); Computational efficiency; Image quality; Newsprint; Optical character recognition; Image matching",,,,,,,,"Terasawa, K., Tanaka, Y., Locality Sensitive Pseudo-Code for Document Images (2007) Proc.

Such artifacts typically appear as thin lines between single characters or glyphs and are in most cases connected to one of the neighboring characters. The quality of the optical character recognition (OCR) is heavily influenced by this type of printing artifacts. The proposed method is based on the detection of (near) vertical segments by means of directional single-connected chains (DSCC). In order to allow the robust processing of complex decorative fonts such as Fraktur, a set of rules is introduced. This allows us to successfully process prints exhibiting artifacts with a stroke width even higher than that of most thin characters stems. We evaluate our approach on a dataset consisting of old newspaper excerpts printed using Fraktur fonts. The recognition results on the enhanced images using two independent OCR engines (ABBYY Fine Reader and Tesseract) show significant improvements over the originals. © 2011 IEEE.","character enhancement; historical documents; hot metal typesetting; OCR; retro-digitization","20th century; Data sets; Historical documents; Historical newspapers; Hot metal; OCR engines; Old newspapers; Printing techniques; retro-digitization; Robust processing; Set of rules; Tesseract; Data processing; Optical character recognition; Typesetting; Newsprint",,,,,,,,"Gatos, B., Ntirogiannis, K., Pratikakis, I., ICDAR 2009 document image binarization contest (DIBCO 2009) Proc.

A full text search using a word spotting technique is no doubt a promising approach in order to facilitate the utilization of digital archives. Some word spotting techniques require the target images to be segmented into character images in advance, however character segmentation is a difficult issue especially for old and degraded document images. This paper figures out the causes that make the character segmentation difficult, and removes them in order to improve the accuracy of character segmentation. We first detect the ruled lines using Hough Transform in order to segment a whole newspaper image into column-separated images. Then we remove the ruled lines as well as ruby characters and noise. The proposed system is tested for 20 column-separated images of historical newspapers, and the accuracy of character segmentation is improved to 96.3%. © 2011 ACM.","character segmentation; digital archive; full text search; historical document; optical character recognition","Character images; Character segmentation; Degraded document images; Digital archives; Full-text search; Historical documents; Historical newspapers; Image processing - methods; Target images; Word Spotting; Digital image storage; Hough transforms; Imaging systems; Newsprint; Optical character recognition; Optical data processing; Processing; Image segmentation",,,,,,,,"http://www.nijl.ac.jp/pages/database/, Database, Japan; Digital Library from the Meiji Era, , http://kindai.ndl.go.jp/, Japan; Terasawa, K., Tanaka, Y., Slit Style HOG Feature for Document Image Word Spotting (2009) Proc.

Many current approaches rely on stored font models that are vulnerable to cases in which the document is noisy or is written in a font dissimilar to the stored fonts. We address these problems by learning character models directly from the document itself, rather than using pre-stored font models. This method has had some success in the past, but we are able to achieve substantial improvement in error reduction through a novel method for creating nearly error-free document-specific training data and building character appearance models from this data. In particular, we first use the state-of-the-art OCR system Tesseract to produce an initial translation. Then, our method identifies a subset of words that we have high confidence have been recognized correctly and uses this subset to bootstrap document-specific character models. We present theoretical justification that a word in the selected subset is very unlikely to be incorrectly recognized, and empirical results on a data set of difficult historical newspaper scans demonstrating that we make only two errors in 56 documents. We then relax the theoretical constraint in order to create a larger training set, and using document-specific character models generated from this data, we are able to reduce the error over properly segmented characters by 34.1% overall from the initial Tesseract translation. ©2010 IEEE.",,"Appearance models; Character models; Data sets; Empirical results; Error reduction; High confidence; High resolution; High-precision; Historical newspapers; Novel methods; Tesseract; Training data; Training sets; Computer vision; Optical character recognition; Security of data; Computational methods",,,,,,,,"Breuel, T., Character recognition by adaptive statistical similarity International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, 2003; Casey, R., Text OCR by solving a cryptogram International Conference on Pattern Recognition, 1986; Edwards, J., Forsyth, D., Searching for character models (2005) Neural Information Processing Systems; Ho, T.K., Bootstrapping text recognition from stop words (1998) International Conference on Pattern Recognition; Ho, T.K., Nagy, G., OCR with no shape training (2000) International Conference on Pattern Recognition; Hobby, J., Ho, T., Enhancing degraded document images via bitmap clustering and averaging International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, 1997; Hong, T., Hull, J., Character segmentation using visual inter-word constraints in a text page Proceedings of SPIE (International Society for Optics and Photonics), 1995; Hong, T., Hull, J., Improving OCR performance with word image equivalence Symposium on Document Analysis and Information Retrieval, 1995; Hong, T., Hull, J.J., Visual inter-word relations and their use in OCR post-processing International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, 1995; Kae, A., Huang, G., Learned-Miller, E., (2009) Bounding the Probability of Error for High Precision Recognition, , Technical Report UM-CS-2009-031, University of Massachusetts Amherst; Kae, A., Learned-Miller, E., Learning on the fly: Font free approaches to difficult OCR problems International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, 2009; Kolak, O., A generative probabilistic ocr model for NLP applications (2003) North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Human Language Technology; Kukich, K., Techniques for automatically correcting words in text (1992) ACM Computing Surveys, 24 (4), pp. 377-439; Lee, D., Substitution deciphering based on HMMs with applications to compressed document processing (2002) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 24, p. 12; Lowe, D., Distinctive image features from scale-invariant keypoints (2004) International Journal of Computer Vision; Nagy, G., Efficient algorithms to decode substitution ciphers with applications to OCR (1986) International Conference on Pattern Recognition; Nagy, G., Twenty years of document image analysis in PAMI (2000) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 22 (1); Tsochantaridis, I., Hofmann, T., Joachims, T., Altun, Y., Support vector machine learning for interdependent and structured output spaces International Conference on Machine Learning, 2004; Wick, M., Ross, M., Learned-Miller, E., Context-sensitive error correction: Using topic models to improve OCR International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, 2007","Kae, A.; Department of Computer Science, , Amherst, MA, United States; email: akae@cs.umass.edu",,,,"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2010","13 June 2010 through 18 June 2010","San Francisco, CA",81491,10636919,9781424469840,PIVRE,,"English","Proc IEEE Comput Soc Conf Comput Vision Pattern Recognit",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955987982

We are exploring interactive services for these collections which would be useful for supporting access, including automatic categorization of articles. Such categorization is difficult because of the uneven quality of the OCR text, but there are many clues which can be useful for improving the accuracy of the categorization. Here, we describe observations of several historical newspapers to determine the characteristics of sections. We then explore how to automatically identify those sections and how to detect serialized feature articles which are repeated across days and weeks. The goal is not the introduction of new algorithms but the development of practical and robust techniques. For both analyses we find substantial success for some categories and articles, but others prove very difficult. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Access; Classification; Digital Humanities; Historian's Workbench; Newspapers; Text Processing","Access; Automated processing; Automatic categorization; Historical newspapers; Interactive services; Robust technique; Search services; History; Newsprint; Text processing; Word processing; Digital libraries",,,,,,,,"Murray, R.L., Toward a Metadata Standard for Digitized Historical Newspapers (2005) Proceedings of IEEE/ACM JCDL, pp. 330-331; Allen, R.B., Waldstein, I., Zhu, W.Z., Automated Processing of Digitized Historical Newspapers: Identification of Segments and Genres (2008) LNCS, 5362, pp. 380-387. , Buchanan, G., Masoodian, M., Cunningham, S.J.

However, searching and linking them with related contents is challenging due to the non-structured text form, digitization errors, and the differences and variations between old and modern language, including historical names (e.g. places), used for querying. This paper addresses these issues by presenting an approach and a system for publishing old texts on the semantic web. As a case study, an existing historical newspaper archive on the web is considered. In our model, semantic metadata is added to the text using automated concept extraction methods. Search is implemented with semantic techniques, by creating a multi-faceted search interface for the text materials. Problems due to OCR errors and spelling variants are addressed with a fuzzy string matching algorithm trying to guess corresponding words in a lexicon, and giving suggestions for corrected word forms. References between texts in the library as well as links between the library and external knowledge sources are formed by using shared ontologies for semantic annotations. © 2009 IEEE.","Automatic semantic annotation; Historical newspapers; Multi-faceted search","AS-links; Concept extraction; Cultural heritages; External knowledge; Faceted search; Historical newspapers; Modern languages; Related content; Semantic annotations; Semantic metadata; Shared ontologies; String matching algorithm; Structured text; Text materials; Data communication systems; Errors; Metadata; Newsprint; Ontology; Research; Semantic Web; Semantics",,,,,,,,"Kanungo, T., Allen, R.B., Full-text access to historical newspapers (1999), Laboratory for Language and Media Processing, University of Maryland, Tech.

Simple text-induced filtering techniques help to retain as many as possible of the true positives and to discard as many as possible of the false positives. ticcl has been evaluated on a contemporary OCR-ed Dutch text corpus and on a corpus of historical newspaper articles, whose OCR-quality is far lower and which is in an older Dutch spelling. Representative samples of typographical variants from both corpora have allowed us not only to properly evaluate our system, but also to draw effective conclusions towards the adaptation of the adopted correction mechanism to OCR-error resolution. The performance scores obtained up to ld 2 mean that the bulk of undesirable OCR-induced typographical variation present can fully automatically be removed. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Computational linguistics; Error correction; Linguistics; Security of data; Software agents; Text processing; Word processing; Correction mechanism; False positives; Filtering techniques; High-frequency words; Intelligent text processing; International conferences; Levenshtein distances; Newspaper articles; Non-interactive; Performance scores; Text corpora; Ionizing radiation",,,,,,,,"Baayen, R.H., The effects of lexical specialization on the growth curve of the vocabulary (1996) Computational Linguistics, 22, pp. 455-480; Evert, S., Baroni, M.: zipfR: Word frequency distributions in R.

This project proposes to digitize and then do OCR and linguisting processing on several years worth of historical newspapers. Newspapers are very complex information objects so developing a rich description of their content is challenging. In addition to frameworks for the logical structure and physical layout, we propose metadata relevant to the image processing and to the historians who will use this collection. Finally, we consider how the metadata infrastructure might be managed as it evolves with improved text processing capabilities and how an infrastructure might be developed to support a community of users.",,"Data structures; Database systems; Digital libraries; Management information systems",,,,,,,,,"Allen, Robert B.; Univ of Maryland, College Park, MD, United States",,"ACM","ACM, New York","Proceedings of the 1999 8th International Conference on Information Knowledge Management (CIKM'99)","2 November 1999 through 6 November 1999","Kansas City, MO, USA",56198,,1581131461; 9781581131468,00217,,"English","Int Conf Inf Knowledge Manage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033279047
