In this, a wide variety of legal, logistical, technical and other challenges were encountered. After introducing the background issues in newspaper digitization in Europe, the paper discusses the technical aspects of refinement in greater detail.

Enriched collections offer new opportunities for interface design to allow data-driven and visualisation-based search, exploration and interpretation. Most such interfaces integrate close and distant reading and represent semantic, spatial, social or temporal relations, but often lack contrastive views. Inspect and Compare (I&C) contributes to the current state of the art in interface design for historical newspapers with highly versatile side-by-side comparisons of query results and curated article sets based on metadata and semantic enrichments. I&C takes search queries and pre-curated article sets as inputs and allows comparisons based on the distributions of newspaper titles, publication dates and automatically generated enrichments, such as language, article types, topics and named entities. Contrastive views of such data reveal patterns, help humanities scholars to improve search strategies and to facilitate a critical assessment of the overall data quality. I&C is part of the impresso interface for the exploration of digitised and semantically enriched historical newspapers. © 2021 by the authors.

What tools should be available on interfaces and how can we avoid too much complexity? What tools are helpful and how can we improve usability?

Research work seeking to automatically process facsimiles and extract information thereby are multiplying with, as a first essential step, document layout analysis. If the identification and categorization of segments of interest in document images have seen significant progress over the last years thanks to deep learning techniques, many challenges remain with, among others, the use of finer-grained segmentation typologies and the consideration of complex, heterogeneous documents such as historical newspapers. Besides, most approaches consider visual features only, ignoring textual signal. In this context, we introduce a multimodal approach for the semantic segmentation of historical newspapers that combines visual and textual features. Based on a series of experiments on diachronic Swiss and Luxembourgish newspapers, we investigate, among others, the predictive power of visual and textual features and their capacity to generalize across time and sources. Results show consistent improvement of multimodal models in comparison to a strong visual baseline, as well as better robustness to high material variance.","2021","2022-02-13 16:48:21","2022-11-04 18:11:57","2022-03-19 01:44:11","","","","HistoInformatics","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","jdmdh.episciences.org","","Publisher: Episciences.org","","/home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/Journal of Data Mining & Digital Humanities/2021/kaplanet al_2021_combining visual and textual features for semantic2.pdf; /home/ebn/Zotero/storage/GKPJNTIU/7097.html","","HEMDIG FRAMEWORK; newspapers; OCR; deep learning; image segmentation; semantic segmentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Este artigo objetiva apresentar e discutir a hemeroteca digital como fonte para a História da Educação potiguar, tendo como foco a investigação acerca do intelectual norte-rio-grandense Nestor dos Santos Lima. O artigo foi construído de modo a descrever o percurso de pesquisa realizado no portal. O recorte espaço-temporal investigado compreendeu os documentos não apenas no Rio Grande do Norte, mas em outros Estados no período de 1900 a 1930. Entre os jornais disponibilizados na Hemeroteca e que se constituíram enquanto resultados da pesquisa apontamos, por exemplo, “O Paiz” e o “Jornal do Comércio” do Rio de Janeiro, o “Correio Paulistano” de São Paulo e o “Diário de Pernambuco”. Para a realização da pesquisa, nos pautamos principalmente em Le Goff (1990), Certeau (1982), Zicman (1985) e Luca (2008). Ressaltamos a potencialidade da imprensa enquanto fonte para História da Educação e a necessidade da crítica ao documento que, muitas vezes se revela parcial e subjetivo, permeado por intencionalidades. Destacamos, sobretudo, a relevância da Hemeroteca Digital enquanto repositório de fontes para a História da Educação. Como possibilidades advindas da pesquisa na hemeroteca digital sobre Nestor Lima, apontamos os indícios da relação que o intelectual constrói com a imprensa, as sociabilidades apresentadas, além das marcas de sua atuação no campo educacional no Estado e sua repercussão nacional durante o período da Primeira República.","2019","2022-05-17 00:52:26","2022-11-04 11:11:33","2022-05-17 00:52:26","39-55","","","2","","","A Hemeroteca Digital Brasileira","","","","","","","pt","Copyright (c)","","","","www.revistas.uneb.br","","","","/home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/Cenas Educacionais/2019/azevedoet al_2019_a hemeroteca digital brasileira.pdf","","HDB; HEMDIG FRAMEWORK; newspapers; OCR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No semantic tags are usually provided, and a PDF file is not designed to be edited or its data interpreted by software. However, data held in PDF files need to be extracted in order to comply with open-source data requirements that are now government-regulated. In the chemical domain, related chemical and property data also need to be found, and their correlations need to be exploited to enable data science in areas such as data-driven materials discovery. Such relationships may be realized using text-mining software such as the “chemistry-aware” natural-language-processing tool, ChemDataExtractor; however, this tool has limited data-extraction capabilities from PDF files. This study presents the PDFDataExtractor tool, which can act as a plug-in to ChemDataExtractor. It outperforms other PDF-extraction tools for the chemical literature by coupling its functionalities to the chemical-named entity-recognition capabilities of ChemDataExtractor. The intrinsic PDF-reading abilities of ChemDataExtractor are much improved. The system features a template-based architecture. This enables semantic information to be extracted from the PDF files of scientific articles in order to reconstruct the logical structure of articles. While other existing PDF-extracting tools focus on quantity mining, this template-based system is more focused on quality mining on different layouts. PDFDataExtractor outputs information in JSON and plain text, including the metadata of a PDF file, such as paper title, authors, affiliation, email, abstract, keywords, journal, year, document object identifier (DOI), reference, and issue number. With a self-created evaluation article set, PDFDataExtractor achieved promising precision for all key assessed metadata areas of the document text.","2022-04-11","2022-05-05 19:16:39","2022-11-04 11:11:33","2022-05-05 19:16:37","1633-1643","","7","62","","J.

Instead of firing up the micro-film reader to navigate the Globe and Mail or the Toronto Star, one needs only to log into online newspaper databases. A keyword search, for a particular event, person, or cultural phenomenon, brings up a list of research findings. Previously impossible research projects can now be attempted. This process has fundamentally reshaped Canadian historical scholarship. We can see this in Canadian history dissertations. In 1998, a year with 67 dissertations, the Toronto Star was cited 74 times. However it was cited 753 times in 2010, a year with 69 dissertations. Similar data appears in the Canadian Historical Review (CHR), a prestigious peer-reviewed journal. Databases are skewing our research. We are witnessing the application of commercial Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology – originally and primarily designed for the efficient digitization of large reams of corporate and legal documents, conventionally formatted – to historical sources. The results are, unsurprisingly, a mixed bag. In this article, I make two arguments. Firstly, online historical databases have profoundly shaped Canadian historiography. In a shift that is rarely – if ever – made explicit, Canadian historians have profoundly reacted to the availability of online databases. Secondly, historians need to understand how OCR works, in order to bring a level of methodological rigor to their work that use these sources. 	,  	  Ça paraît si bien classé, si complet. Au lieu d’allumer le lecteur de microfilms pour sillonner le Globe and Mail ou le Toronto Star, on a seulement besoin de se connecter aux bases de données en ligne des journaux. Pour tout événement, toute personne ou tout phénomène culturel, une recherche par mot clé génère une liste de résultats. Des projets de recherche autrefois impossibles sont maintenant lancés. La recherche de pointe en histoire au Canada a été radicalement transformée, et les thèses en histoire canadienne nous le prouvent. Les 67 thèses déposées en 1998 ont cité le Toronto Star 74 fois; les 69 thèses déposées en 2010 l’ont plutôt cité 753 fois. Des données semblables s’observent dans la Canadian Historical Review (CHR), une prestigieuse revue périodique à comité de lecture. Les bases de données biaisent la recherche. La technologie commerciale de reconnaissance de caractères, initialement et principalement conçue pour numériser efficacement d’énormes quantités de documents d’entreprise ou juridiques à la mise en forme conventionnelle, s’applique désormais aux sources en histoire avec, sans surprise, des résultats qui laissent parfois à désirer. Je défendrai deux idées dans cet article. Premièrement, les bases de données historiques en ligne ont profondément marqué l’historiographie canadienne. On admet peu, si tant est qu’on le fasse, à quel point les historiens canadiens ont investi les bases de données en ligne. Deuxièmement, les historiens doivent comprendre comment fonctionne la reconnaissance de caractères pour garantir la rigueur méthodologique de leurs travaux fondés sur ces sources.","2013","2022-04-27 12:03:48","2022-11-04 11:11:33","2022-04-27 12:03:48","540-569","","4","94","","","Illusionary Order","","","","","","","","","","","","Project MUSE","","Publisher: University of Toronto Press","","/home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/The Canadian Historical Review/2013/milligan_2013_illusionary order.pdf","","databases; HEMDIG FRAMEWORK; newspapers; OCR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such methods are dependent on optical character recognition (OCR) which converts the document images into textual representations. Nowadays, OCR methods are often not adapted to the historical domain; moreover, they usually need a significant amount of annotated documents. Therefore, this paper introduces a set of methods that allows performing an OCR on historical document images using only a small amount of real, manually annotated training data. The presented complete OCR system includes two main tasks: page layout analysis including text block and line segmentation and OCR. Our segmentation methods are based on fully convolutional networks, and the OCR approach utilizes recurrent neural networks. Both approaches are state of the art in the relevant fields. We have created a novel real dataset for OCR from Porta fontium portal. This corpus is freely available for research, and all proposed methods are evaluated on these data. We show that both the segmentation and OCR tasks are feasible with only a few annotated real data samples. The experiments aim at determining the best way how to achieve good performance with the given small set of data. We also demonstrate that obtained scores are comparable or even better than the scores of several state-of-the-art systems. To sum up, this paper shows a way how to create an efficient OCR system for historical documents with a need for only a little annotated training data.","2020-12-01","2021-01-05 17:28:41","2022-11-04 11:11:33","2021-11-24 22:33:24","17209-17227","","23","32","","Neural Comput & Applic","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/Neural Computing and Applications/2020/martínek_et_al_2020_building_an_efficient_ocr_system_for_historical_documents_with_little_training.pdf; /home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/Neural Computing and Applications/2020/martínek_et_al_2020_building_an_efficient_ocr_system_for_historical_documents_with_little_training2.pdf","","HEMDIG FRAMEWORK; OCR; neural networks; historical documents; documentos históricos; porta fontium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, the word ‘nation’ and its historical usage are very vague. The aim in this article was to develop a data-driven method using dependency parsing and neural word embeddings to clarify some of the vagueness in the evolution of this concept. To this end, we propose the following two-step method. First, using linguistic processing, we create a large set of words pertaining to the topic of nation. Second, we train diachronic word embeddings and use them to quantify the strength of the semantic similarity between these words and thereby create meaningful clusters, which are then aligned diachronically. To illustrate the robustness of the study across languages, time spans, as well as large datasets, we apply it to the entirety of five historical newspaper archives in Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, and English. To our knowledge, thus far there have been no large-scale comparative studies of this kind that purport to grasp long-term developments in as many as four different languages in a data-driven way. A particular strength of the method we describe in this article is that, by design, it is not limited to the study of nationhood, but rather expands beyond it to other research questions and is reusable in different contexts.","2021-10-01","2021-11-09 02:18:57","2022-11-04 11:11:33","2021-11-29 23:23:11","ii109-ii126","","Supplement_2","36","","Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/Digital Scholarship in the Humanities/2021/hengchen_et_al_2021_a_data-driven_approach_to_studying_changing_vocabularies_in_historical.pdf; /home/ebn/Zotero/storage/WSGXJITP/6421793.html","","data-driven method; HEMDIG FRAMEWORK; newspapers; word embedding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In what specific ways are newspapers transformed in the digitization process? If the digitized document is not the same as the source document – is it still a historical record, or is it transformed into something else?                                         Design/methodology/approach                                The authors have analyzed the XML files from                 Aftonbladet                 1830 to 1862. The most frequent newspaper words not matching a high-quality references corpus were selected to zoom in on the noisiest part of the paper. The variety of the interpretations generated by optical character recognition (OCR) was examined, as well as texts generated by auto-segmentation. The authors have made a limited ethnographic study of the digitization process.

How the tools work is mostly unknown to the staff involved in the digitization process? Sticking to any idea of a provenance chain is hence impossible, since many steps have been outsourced to unknown factors affecting the source document.                                                        Originality/value               The detail examination of digitally transformed newspapers is valuable to scholars depending on newspaper databases in their research. The paper also highlights the fact that libraries outsourcing digitization processes run the risk of losing control over the quality of their collections.","2017-10-12","2021-09-15 02:32:47","2022-11-04 11:11:33","2021-09-15 02:32:47","1228-1243","","6","73","","JD","Cultural heritage as digital noise","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/Journal of Documentation/2017/jarlbrink_snickars_2017_cultural_heritage_as_digital_noise.pdf","","article segmentation; cultural heritage; HEMDIG FRAMEWORK; large-scale digitization; newspapers; OCR; XML","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As gateways to enriched material, such interfaces are however not neutral and play a fundamental role in how users perceive historical sources, understand potential biases of upstream processes and benefit from the opportunities of datafication. What features can be found in current interfaces, and to what degree do interfaces adopt novel technologies?

Such systems avoid the task of character segmentation necessary for character-based approaches. A disadvantage of this approach is a need of a large amount of annotated data. This can be solved by sing generated synthetic data instead of costly manually annotated ones. Unfortunately, such data is often not suitable for historical documents particularly for quality reasons. This work presents a hybrid approach for generating annotated data for OCR at a low cost. We first collect a small dataset of isolated characters from historical document images. Then, we generate historical looking text lines from the generated characters. Another contribution lies in the design and implementation of an OCR system based on a convolutional-LSTM network. We first pre-train this system on hybrid data. Afterwards, the network is fine-tuned with real printed text lines. We demonstrate that this training strategy is efficient for obtaining state-of-the-art results. We also show that the score of the proposed system is comparable or even better in comparison to several state-of-the-art systems.","2019-09","2021-01-05 17:29:17","2022-11-04 11:11:33","","565-570","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2379-2140","","/home/ebn/Zotero/storage/JAYHNVQV/8978139.html; /home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/undefined/2019/martínek_et_al_2019_hybrid_training_data_for_historical_text_ocr.pdf","","HEMDIG FRAMEWORK; historical documents; neural networks; OCR","annotated data; character segmentation; character-based approaches; CNN, Hybrid Training, Historical Documents, LSTM, Neural Networks, OCR; convolutional-LSTM network; document image processing; generated characters; historical document images; historical looking text lines; historical text OCR; history; hybrid data; Hybrid power systems; hybrid training data; image segmentation; Image segmentation; isolated characters; learning (artificial intelligence); natural language processing; OCR system; optical character recognition; Optical character recognition software; optical character recognition systems; printed text lines; quality reasons; recurrent neural nets; recurrent neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; text analysis; Text recognition; Tools; Training; training strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been shown that the leverage of pre-trained language models improves the overall performance on many tasks and is highly beneficial when labeled data is scarce. In this work, we train Portuguese BERT models and employ a BERT-CRF architecture to the NER task on the Portuguese language, combining the transfer capabilities of BERT with the structured predictions of CRF. We explore feature-based and fine-tuning training strategies for the BERT model.

The corpus, which is to comprise 150 millions tokens, is expected to provide selected texts from four centuries of Latin written production (from 800 to 1200 AD) from all across Europe. It will also cover a wide gamut of genres from theological texts to historiography, to documents and letters. In the first stage of the project, that started in the mid-2018, we are selecting the texts to be included in the corpus, basing on the metadata in the electronic database of Medieval Latin texts that is, at the moment, the largest scholarly-driven source of information of this kind available free on the Internet. Once selected, the texts are retrieved from existing collections and digital libraries. As early tests showed, less than a half of the texts already exist in interoperable formats such as TEI XML, or at least in a form that allows for easy conversion which does not require human intervention. This means that the bulk of the corpus texts has to be acquired from digital images of editions available on-line through OCR and post-processing. For both tasks, there now exists a broad range of efficient tools, and many sophisticated workflows were proposed in literature. However, the presented project is significantly limited when it comes to its resources, since one person is expected to work on controlling the process and improving OCR quality during a single year. In the presentation we would like, first, to demonstrate the workflow of the project which, at the moment, consists of the 1) image extraction from PDF files, 2) image cleaning, and its subsequent 3) OCR, followed by 4) the batch-correction of the OCR errors, and 5) the removal of the non-Latin text with a simple classifier. The tools we use are all free and open source, an important factor in a project which is low on resources but ambitious in its goals. The PDF extraction and conversion are performed with Linux 'convert' and 'pdfimages' commands. The output TIFFs are cleaned with the ""ScanTailor"", while the OCR is realised with ""Tesseract"". To save on time, the entire workflow is automated, with the human analyst verifying the quality of the output and mass-correcting OCR errors with the ""Post Correction Tool"". Apart from presenting the project and the workflow, the paper will discuss the challenges we have faced. One of the most problematic issues turned out to be the relatively disparate quality of the image files retrieved from online sources. Another factor that significantly hinders the automatic processing was the quality of text editions.","2019-05-08","2021-03-13 19:37:12","2022-11-04 11:11:33","2021-01-04","81–85","","","","","","","DATeCH2019","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","/home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/Association for Computing Machinery/2019/bonet al_2019_challenges of mass ocr-isation of medieval latin texts in a.pdf","","HEMDIG FRAMEWORK; velum project","OCR; corpus; image processing; OCR error correction; Latin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

K-12 students and teachers were relegated to the little they could get to locally because they did not have the money needed to experience primary historical sources themselves. These limitations kept many students and teachers from getting excited about research. Digital archives, however, allow anyone access to primary sources in a nonlinear environment. Because of this, archivists should strive to create digital archives from a large variety of voices. In this way, the history classroom should be radically changed to foster historical inquiry and personal connections to historical content.

This step is commonly referred to as page segmentation. While various rule-based algorithms have been proposed, the applicability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for this task recently has gained a lot of attention. In this paper, we perform a systematic evaluation of 11 different published DNN backbone architectures and 9 different tiling and scaling configurations for separating text, tables or table column lines. We also show the influence of the number of labels and the number of training pages on the segmentation quality, which we measure using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Our results show that (depending on the task) Inception-ResNet-v2 and EfficientNet backbones work best, vertical tiling is generally preferable to other tiling approaches, and training data that comprises 30 to 40 pages will be sufficient most of the time.","2020-04-15","2022-01-29 18:53:07","2022-11-04 11:11:33","2022-01-29 18:53:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2004.07317","","/home/ebn/Zotero/storage/GGS42FM5/2004.html; /home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/arXiv2004.07317 [cs]/2020/liebl_burghardt_2020_an evaluation of dnn architectures for page segmentation of.pdf","","HEMDIG FRAMEWORK; newspapers; OCR; page segmentation; deep neural networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We consider the problem of processing a large corpus of unstructured textual information to extract network data. The corpus consists of almost 170,000 documents of administrative correspondence of the Portuguese Empire, from 1610 to 1833, catalogued in the Portuguese Overseas Archives of Lisbon. Our contribution is twofold: the method and the result. Firstly, grounded in the review of manual, semi-manual and automatic methods of network data extraction from natural language corpora, we propose and demonstrate an approach using modern natural language processing algorithms. This approach tries to mimic traditional archivist’s coding practices and is applicable to large corpora of texts, for which manual coding is infeasible because of scale. We believe our approach is generic and adaptable to other substantive contexts, languages, and types of historical archives. Secondly, the dataset created is rich in additional information such as occupation, administrative affiliation, and geographical location of senders and recipients. We provide a preliminary network analysis suggesting that the dataset is an attractive material for historians and social network researchers for addressing research questions about the political and social evolution of the early modern Portuguese Empire, spanning the reign of seven Portuguese monarchs.","2020-09-24","2020-09-25 16:35:40","2022-11-04 11:11:33","2020-09-25 16:35:39","","","","","","Social Networks","Networks from archives","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/Social Networks/2020/błoch_et_al_2020_networks_from_archives.pdf; /home/ebn/Zotero/storage/VMVVY2IQ/S0378873320300769.html","","HEMDIG FRAMEWORK; NER; NLP; portuguese","Digital humanities; Natural language processing; Colonial studies; Correspondence networks; Early modern letters; Historical network research; Portuguese empire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It demonstrates that the polarized nature of the literature about this technological development is far from unprecedented, and in fact can be traced through the theory of a number of varied fields: the debate surrounding mechanization and digital technologies, our understanding of the role of the sublime in modern representations of technology, the similarities between the sociology of city life and digital information overload, and the way in which innovations are diffused throughout society. It proposes that these theories explain why debates around technological innovation often become so hyperbolic, creating an almost mythological view of technological determination. It concludes that, as a result of the processes outlined in this theory, mass digitization has become stuck between two conflicting rhetorical movements, and that it is therefore necessary to begin working to increase our understanding of this technology and to move the debate onwards using evidence from the real world.","2013-12","2020-01-27 17:04:17","2022-11-04 11:11:33","2020-01-27 17:04:13","629-639","","4","28","","","The myth of the new","","","","","","","en","","","","","eprints.gla.ac.uk","","","","/home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/Literary and Linguistic Computing/2013/goodinget al_2013_the myth of the new.pdf","","HEMDIG FRAMEWORK; large-scale digitization; distant reading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A model for task-based information interaction guided the collection and analysis of data. Findings The study revealed numerous information interactions within activities related to task-planning, the search process, selecting and working with the items and synthesis and reporting. The information interactions differ with the activities involved, which call for system support mechanisms specific to each activity type. Various activities feature information search, which is an essential research method for those using digital collections in the compilation and analysis of data. Furthermore, application of quantitative methods and multidisciplinary collaboration may be shaping culture in history research toward convergence with the research culture of the natural sciences.

"MVJ7RF3V","book","2012","Galloway, Alexander R.","The Interface Effect","","978-0-7456-6253-4","","","","Interfaces are back, or perhaps they never left. The familiar Socratic conceit from the Phaedrus, of communication as the process of writing directly on the soul of the other, has returned to center stage in today's discussions of culture and media. Indeed Western thought has long construed media as a grand choice between two kinds of interfaces. Following the optimistic path, media seamlessly interface self and other in a transparent and immediate connection. But, following the pessimistic path, media are the obstacles to direct communion, disintegrating self and other into misunderstanding and contradiction. In other words, media interfaces are either clear or complicated, either beautiful or deceptive, either already known or endlessly interpretable. Recognizing the limits of either path, Galloway charts an alternative course by considering the interface as an autonomous zone of aesthetic activity, guided by its own logic and its own ends: the interface effect. Rather than praising user-friendly interfaces that work well, or castigating those that work poorly, this book considers the unworkable nature of all interfaces, from windows and doors to screens and keyboards. Considered allegorically, such thresholds do not so much tell the story of their own operations but beckon outward into the realm of social and political life, and in so doing ask a question to which the political interpretation of interfaces is the only coherent answer. Grounded in philosophy and cultural theory and driven by close readings of video games, software, television, painting, and other images, Galloway seeks to explain the logic of digital culture through an analysis of its most emblematic and ubiquitous manifestation –  the interface.","2012-10-08","2022-02-07 18:05:53","2022-11-04 11:11:33","","","183","","","","","","","","","","Polity","Cambridge","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","false; ","; https://books.google.com.br/books?id=lCd-zMDjKiYC","GUI; HEMDIG FRAMEWORK","Computers / Information Technology; Computers / Social Aspects; Social Science / Media Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work provides a major breakthrough in the digitization of newspapers on three fronts: first, releasing a dataset of 3000 fully-annotated, real-world newspaper images from 21 different U.S. states representing an extensive variety of complex layouts for document layout analysis; second, proposing layout segmentation as a precursor to existing optical character recognition (OCR) engines, where multiple state-of-the-art image segmentation models and several post-processing methods are explored for document layout segmentation; third, providing a thorough and structured evaluation protocol for isolated layout segmentation and end-to-end OCR.","2022-06-28","2023-05-29 18:40:48","2023-05-29 18:41:17","2023-05-29 18:40:48","12643-12649","","11","36","","","DocBed","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2022 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence","","","","ojs.aaai.org","","Number: 11","","/home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence/2022/zhu et al_2022_docbed.pdf","","HEMDIG FRAMEWORK","Historical Document Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the scale of the UKGWA exposes the limits of the current search interface, and there is no facility to understand the archive in aggregate. This article seeks to go beyond the simple keyword search by exploring the data sources available, from APIs to web crawling, for computational analysis of the UKGWA.

However, the scale of these archives can limit the direct application of advanced text processing methods. Even if it is computationally feasible to apply sophisticated language processing to an entire digital archive, if the material of interest is a small fraction of the archive, the results are unlikely to be useful. Methods for generating smaller specialized corpora from large archives are required to solve this problem. This article presents such a method for historical newspaper archives digitized using the METS/ALTO XML standard (Veridian Software, n.d.). The method is an ‘iterative bootstrapping’ approach in which candidate corpora are evaluated using text mining techniques, items are manually labelled, and Naïve Bayes text classifiers are trained and applied in order to produce new candidate corpora. The method is illustrated by a case study that investigates philosophical content, broadly construed, in pre-1900 English-language New Zealand newspapers. Extensive code is provided in Supplementary Materials.","2023-06-01","2023-08-07 23:56:28","2023-08-08 00:06:46","2023-08-07 23:56:28","779-797","","2","38","","Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","Creating specialized corpora from digitized historical newspaper archives","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/home/ebn/Zotero/storage/M9EURASQ/6957053.html; /home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/Digital Scholarship in the Humanities/2023/wilson black_2023_creating specialized corpora from digitized historical.pdf","","HEMDIG FRAMEWORK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A leaf falls from a tree and lands on the surface of the water, carried by ripples and whirlpools to a new place far removed from ins origin. There is he able to form new streams in calm water. This image is a metaphor, representing the interweaving of technology with the practices and values of humanities research, being both a point of intersection and a torrent of unexpected and predictable contingencies. Logical methods in the digital humanities lend themselves well to theory and documentation. At a level of a distinct set of defined statistical topics that can be generated using a software tool such as MALLET (Machine Learning for Language toolkit, a cross – platform topic modeling tool) rather that a set equivalent retrieved a linear normal reading process, representing the difference in degree. The methodological stake and consequences of the choice for the knowledge it creates are questioned, but taken into account and understood in scientific discussions. The falling leaf, getting into the wave, continues to move down, and the open frame of its fall can be lost, changing the path of the leaf. However, the leaf may later grow together, thus forming a barrier that affects further flows. Technology is sublimated into the fabric of scientific methods and the organization of the work of scientists is marked by a certain inevitability because of the methodological forces at work and because of the technologies that enable communication and interaction in the wide society.","2023","2023-08-07 23:59:59","2023-08-08 00:06:46","2023-08-07 23:59:59","05001","","","172","","SHS Web Conf.","","","","","","","","en","© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2023","","","","www.shs-conferences.org","","Publisher: EDP Sciences","","/home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/SHS Web of Conferences/2023/dzhukaeva et al_2023_digital technology and practices of humanities research.pdf","","HEMDIG FRAMEWORK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many tools go beyond key word search and perform different types of analysis, aggregation, mapping, and linking of data selections, which transforms materials and creates new perspectives, thereby changing the way scholars interact with and perceive their materials. These tools, together with the massive amount of digital and digitized data available for humanities research, put a strain on traditional humanities research methods. Currently, there is no established method of assessing the role of digital tools in the research trajectory of humanities scholars. There is no consensus on what questions researchers should ask themselves to evaluate digital sources beyond those of traditional analogue source criticism. This article aims to contribute to a better understanding of digital tools and the discussion of how to evaluate and incorporate them in research, based on findings from a digital tool criticism workshop held at the 2017 Digital Humanities Benelux conference. The overall goal of this article is to provide insight in the actual use and practice of digital tool criticism, offer a ready-made format for a workshop on digital tool criticism, give insight in aspects that play a role in digital tool criticism, propose an elaborate model for digital tool criticism that can be used as common ground for further conversations in the field, and finally, provide recommendations for future workshops, researchers, data custodians, and tool builders.","2019-06-01","2023-08-08 00:05:09","2023-08-08 00:06:46","2023-08-08 00:05:09","368-385","","2","34","","Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","Toward a model for digital tool criticism","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/home/ebn/pCloudDrive/zot_library/Digital Scholarship in the Humanities/2019/koolen et al_2019_toward a model for digital tool criticism.pdf; /home/ebn/Zotero/storage/BPHG8FFZ/5127711.html","","HEMDIG FRAMEWORK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Initially offering access to full text search and facsimiles visualization only, historic newspaper user interfaces are increasingly integrating advanced exploration features based on the application of text mining tools to digitized sources. As gateways to enriched material, such interfaces are however not neutral and play a fundamental role in how users perceive historical sources, understand potential biases of upstream processes and benefit from the opportunities of datafication. What features can be found in current interfaces, and to what degree do interfaces adopt novel technologies? This paper presents a survey of interfaces for digitized historical newspapers with the aim of mapping the current state of the art and identifying recent trends with regard to content presentation, enrichment and user interaction. We devised 6 interface assessment criteria and reviewed twenty-four interfaces based on ca. 140 predefined features.","","2023-08-21 17:53:43","2023-08-21 17:53:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/home/ebn/Zotero/storage/YE9U9Z3Y/Ehrmann - Historical Newspaper User Interfaces A Review.pdf","","HEMDIG FRAMEWORK","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
