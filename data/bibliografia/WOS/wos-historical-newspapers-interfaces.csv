It is bound up with the early modern period of history. Historical newspapers are of utmost importance to nations and its people, and researchers from different disciplines rely on these papers to improve our understanding of the past. In pursuit of satisfying this need, Istanbul University Head Office of Library and Documentation provides access to a big database of scanned historical newspapers. To take it another step further and make the documents more accessible, we need to run optical character recognition (OCR) and named entity recognition (NER) tasks on the whole database and index the results to allow for full-text search mechanism. We design and implement a system encompassing the whole pipeline starting from scrapping the dataset from the original website to providing a graphical user interface to run search queries, and it manages to do that successfully. Proposed system provides to search people, culture and security-related keywords and to visualise them. © The Author(s) 2021.","2021","2022-11-04 12:01:34","2023-09-01 16:53:48","","335-347","","2","49","","J Inf Sci","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","WOS:000634018700001","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","Data journalism; Design and implements; full-text search; Full-text search; Graphical user interfaces; HEMDIG - SCOPUS; HEMDIG - WOS; historical newspapers; Historical newspapers; Istanbul; microservices; named entity recognition; Named entity recognition; NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION; Natural language processing systems; Newsprint; Office buildings; optical character recognition; Optical character recognition; Optical character recognition (OCR); SCOPUS; Search queries; SEGMENTATION; Turkishs; visualisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, searching and linking them with related contents is challenging due to the non-structured text form, digitization errors, and the differences and variations between old and modern language, including historical names (e.g. places), used for querying. This paper addresses these issues by presenting an approach and a system for publishing old texts on the semantic web. As a case study, an existing historical newspaper archive on the web is considered. In our model, semantic metadata is added to the text using automated concept extraction methods. Search is implemented with semantic techniques, by creating a multi-faceted search interface for the text materials. Problems due to OCR errors and spelling variants are addressed with a fuzzy string matching algorithm trying to guess corresponding words in a lexicon, and giving suggestions for corrected word forms. References between texts in the library as well as links between the library and external knowledge sources are formed by using shared ontologies for semantic annotations. © 2009 IEEE.","2009","2022-11-04 12:02:22","2023-09-01 16:58:41","2009-09-14","167-173","","","","","","","","","","","","Berkeley, CA","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ICSC - IEEE Int.

Enriched collections offer new opportunities for interface design to allow data-driven and visualisation-based search, exploration and interpretation. Most such interfaces integrate close and distant reading and represent semantic, spatial, social or temporal relations, but often lack contrastive views. Inspect and Compare (I&C) contributes to the current state of the art in interface design for historical newspapers with highly versatile side-by-side comparisons of query results and curated article sets based on metadata and semantic enrichments. I&C takes search queries and pre-curated article sets as inputs and allows comparisons based on the distributions of newspaper titles, publication dates and automatically generated enrichments, such as language, article types, topics and named entities. Contrastive views of such data reveal patterns, help humanities scholars to improve search strategies and to facilitate a critical assessment of the overall data quality. I&C is part of the impresso interface for the exploration of digitised and semantically enriched historical newspapers. © 2021 by the authors.

Investigating search patterns can help them to improve the user interface, collection management and search algorithms. However, search patterns may vary widely in different parts of a collection. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how to identify these search patterns within a well-curated historical newspaper collection using the existing metadata. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyzed search logs combined with metadata records describing the content of the collection, using this metadata to create subsets in the logs corresponding to different parts of the collection. Findings: The study shows that faceted search is more prevalent than non-faceted search in terms of number of unique queries, time spent, clicks and downloads. Distinct search patterns are observed in different parts of the collection, corresponding to historical periods, geographical regions or subject matter. Originality/value: First, this study provides deeper insights into search behavior at a fine granularity in a historical newspaper collection, by the inclusion of the metadata in the analysis. Second, it demonstrates how to use metadata categorization as a way to analyze distinct search patterns in a collection. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2019","2022-11-04 12:03:08","2023-09-01 16:57:25","","270-286","","2","75","","J.

The aim of this study is to identify user interests in diferent parts of an online collection and investigate the related search behavior. To do this, we propose to use the metadata of selected facets and clicked documents as features for clustering sessions identiied in user logs. We evaluate the session clusters by measuring their stability over a six-month period. We apply our approach to data from the National Library of the Netherlands, a typical digital library with a richly annotated historical newspaper collection and a faceted search interface. Our results show that users interested in speciic parts of the collection use diferent search techniques. We demonstrate that a metadata-based clustering helps to reveal and understand user interests in terms of the collection, and how search behavior is related to speciic parts within the collection. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Much less attention has been paid to newspapers published for a more specialized audience, e.g., those aiming at scholarly or cultural exchange within intellectual communities much narrower in scope, such as newspapers devoted to music criticism, arts or philosophy. Only some few of these specialized newspapers have been digitized up until now, but they are usually not well curated in terms of digitization quality, data formatting, completeness, redundancy (de-duplication), supply of metadata, and, hence, searchability. This paper describes our approach to eliminate these drawbacks for a major German-language newspaper resource of the Romantic Age, the Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung (General Music Gazette). We here focus on a workflow that copes with a posteriori digitization problems, inconsistent OCRing and index building for searchability. In addition, we provide a user-friendly graphic interface to empower content-centric access to this (and other) digital resource(s) adopting open-source software for the purpose of Web presentation. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC","2020","2022-11-04 12:03:03","2023-09-01 16:56:27","2020-05-11","969-976","","","","","","","","","","","European Language Resources Association (ELRA)","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: LREC - Int.
