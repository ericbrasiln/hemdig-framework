It is bound up with the early modern period of history. Historical newspapers are of utmost importance to nations and its people, and researchers from different disciplines rely on these papers to improve our understanding of the past. In pursuit of satisfying this need, Istanbul University Head Office of Library and Documentation provides access to a big database of scanned historical newspapers. To take it another step further and make the documents more accessible, we need to run optical character recognition (OCR) and named entity recognition (NER) tasks on the whole database and index the results to allow for full-text search mechanism. We design and implement a system encompassing the whole pipeline starting from scrapping the dataset from the original website to providing a graphical user interface to run search queries, and it manages to do that successfully. Proposed system provides to search people, culture and security-related keywords and to visualise them. © The Author(s) 2021.","2021","2022-11-04 12:01:34","2023-09-01 16:53:48","","335-347","","2","49","","J Inf Sci","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","WOS:000634018700001","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","Data journalism; Design and implements; full-text search; Full-text search; Graphical user interfaces; HEMDIG - SCOPUS; HEMDIG - WOS; historical newspapers; Historical newspapers; Istanbul; microservices; named entity recognition; Named entity recognition; NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION; Natural language processing systems; Newsprint; Office buildings; optical character recognition; Optical character recognition; Optical character recognition (OCR); SCOPUS; Search queries; SEGMENTATION; Turkishs; visualisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many current approaches rely on stored font models that are vulnerable to cases in which the document is noisy or is written in a font dissimilar to the stored fonts. We address these problems by learning character models directly from the document itself, rather than using pre-stored font models. This method has had some success in the past, but we are able to achieve substantial improvement in error reduction through a novel method for creating nearly error-free document-specific training data and building character appearance models from this data. In particular, we first use the state-of-the-art OCR system Tesseract to produce an initial translation. Then, our method identifies a subset of words that we have high confidence have been recognized correctly and uses this subset to bootstrap document-specific character models. We present theoretical justification that a word in the selected subset is very unlikely to be incorrectly recognized, and empirical results on a data set of difficult historical newspaper scans demonstrating that we make only two errors in 56 documents. We then relax the theoretical constraint in order to create a larger training set, and using document-specific character models generated from this data, we are able to reduce the error over properly segmented characters by 34.1% overall from the initial Tesseract translation. ©2010 IEEE.","2010","2022-11-04 12:02:20","2023-09-01 16:58:33","2010-06-13","1935-1942","","","","","","","","","","","","San Francisco, CA","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc IEEE Comput Soc Conf Comput Vision Pattern Recognit","","","","Appearance models; Character models; Computational methods; Computer vision; Data sets; Empirical results; Error reduction; HEMDIG - SCOPUS; HEMDIG - WOS; High confidence; High resolution; High-precision; Historical newspapers; Novel methods; Optical character recognition; SCOPUS; Security of data; Tesseract; Training data; Training sets","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2010","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since historical newspapers differ from recent newspapers in image quality, type fonts and language usages, optical character recognition (OCR) does not provide sufficient quality. Instead of OCR approach, we adopted appearance-based approach, that means we matched character to character with its shapes. Assuming proper character segmentation and proper feature description, full-text search problem is reduced to sequence matching problem of feature vector. To increase computational efficiency, we adopted pseudo-code expression called LSPC, which is a compact sketch of feature vector while retaining a good deal of its information. Experimental result showed that our method can retrieve a query string from a text of over eight million characters within a second. In addition, we predict that more sophisticated algorithm could be designed for LSPC. As an example, we established the Extended Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm that can reduce the computational cost further especially when the query string becomes longer. © 2011 IEEE.","2011","2022-11-04 12:02:17","2023-09-01 16:58:26","2011-09-18","1379-1383","","","","","","","","","","","","Beijing","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

If some variables can be identified with near certainty, they can be conditioned upon, allowing further inference to be done efficiently. Specifically, we consider optical character recognition (OCR) systems that can be bootstrapped by identifying a subset of correctly translated document words with very high precision. This ""clean set"" is subsequently used as document-specific training data. While OCR systems produce confidence measures for the identity of each letter or word, thresholding these values still produces a significant number of errors. We introduce a novel technique for identifying a set of correct words with very high precision. Rather than estimating posterior probabilities, we bound the probability that any given word is incorrect using an approximate worst case analysis. We give empirical results on a data set of difficult historical newspaper scans, demonstrating that our method for identifying correct words makes only two errors in 56 documents.

This platform has been designed to provide a user experience as intuitive as possible by using mature open source tools. All the features are implemented thanks to the Spring framework. To meet this goal, we created a system to display tiled high-resolution images operating without a plug-in but based on an open source solution called IIPImage. The platform also allows for full-text searches thanks to the Java search library Apache Lucene and displays the results in the form of newspaper articles. In addition, we established collaborative features to provide the users with the ability to correct the content automatically generated by our document processing workflow and accessed through the browsing platform. The system is able to store all the corrections of the users, by using the couple Hibernate/MySQL. The aim is to enable continuous improvement of both the content quality and the search accuracy, by exploiting the ability of the users to recognize significant errors, in order to enhance the digital objects representing the newspaper issues. The proposed system is designed to generate metadata describing the physical layout, but also the logical structure of newspaper documents. Our article segmentation analyses a newspaper issue and recognizes articles, even if they straddle more than one page or if they spread in a complex structure. The workflow can also consider as input data, the results of optical character recognition (OCR) engines in order to provide a textual indexation of the segmented articles. By using this system, we want to create a true and representative digital object using standard formats (i.e. METS / ALTO) and containing the logical description of the content, making easier reading and understanding by the users. ©2012 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.","2012","2022-11-04 12:02:15","2023-09-01 16:58:22","2012-06-12","48-53","","","","","","","","","","","","Copenhagen","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Arch. - Preserv.

The quality of the optical character recognition (OCR) is heavily influenced by this type of printing artifacts. The proposed method is based on the detection of (near) vertical segments by means of directional single-connected chains (DSCC). In order to allow the robust processing of complex decorative fonts such as Fraktur, a set of rules is introduced. This allows us to successfully process prints exhibiting artifacts with a stroke width even higher than that of most thin characters stems. We evaluate our approach on a dataset consisting of old newspaper excerpts printed using Fraktur fonts.

First, approximate string matching methods were used to generate lists of index words most similar to contemporary query terms in a digitized newspaper collection from the 1800s. Top index word variants were categorized to estimate the appropriate query expansion ranges in the retrieval test. Second, the effectiveness of approximate string matching methods, automatically generated inflectional forms, and their combinations were measured in a Cranfield-style test. Finally, a detailed topic-level analysis of test results was conducted. In the index of historical newspaper collection the occurrences of a word typically spread to many linguistic and historical variants along with optical character recognition (OCR) errors. All query expansion methods improved the baseline results. Extensive expansion of around 30 variants for each query word was required to achieve the highest performance improvement. Query expansion based on approximate string matching was superior to using the inflectional forms of the query words, showing that coverage of the different types of variation is more important than precision in handling one type of variation. © 2015 ASIS&T","2016","2022-11-04 12:02:01","2023-09-01 16:57:49","","2928-2946","","12","67","","J.

It may also be combined with methods to estimate the parameters of a noisy channel model of OCR errors. Additionally, the current method generalizes previous proposals for a simple majority- vote combination of known duplicated texts. On a corpus of historical newspapers, an annotated set of clusters has a baseline word error rate (WER) of 33%. A majority vote procedure reaches 23% on passages where one or more duplicates were found, and consensus decoding combined with a language model achieves 18% WER. In a separate experiment, newspapers were aligned to very widely reprinted texts such as State of the Union speeches, producing clusters with up to 58 witnesses.

Zoning document images such as digitized historical newspaper pages are challenging due to noise and quality of the document images. Recently, effective data-driven approaches, such as leveraging deep learning, have been proposed, albeit with the concern of requiring larger training data and thus incurring additional cost of ground truthing. We propose a zoning solution by incorporating a knowledge-driven document representation, gravity map, into a multimodal deep learning framework to reduce the amount of time and data required for training. We first generate a gravity map for each image, considering the centroid distance and area between a cell in a Voronoi tessellation and its content to encode visual domain knowledge of a zoning task. Second, we inject the gravity maps into a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) during training, as an additional modality to boost performance. We report on two investigations using two state-of-the-art DCNN architectures and three datasets: two sets of historical newspapers and a set of born-digital contemporary documents. Evaluations show that our solution achieved comparable segmentation accuracy using fewer training epochs and less training data compared to a naïve training scheme. © 2021 SPIE and IS&T.","2021","2022-11-04 12:01:30","2023-09-01 16:54:54","","","","6","30","","J.

The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of different quality OCR on users' subjective perception through an interactive information retrieval task with a collection of one digitized historical Finnish newspaper.Design/methodology/approachThis study is based on the simulated work task model used in interactive information retrieval. Thirty-two users made searches to an article collection of Finnish newspaper Uusi Suometar 1869-1918 which consists of ca. 1.45 million autosegmented articles. The article search database had two versions of each article with different quality OCR. Each user performed six pre-formulated and six self-formulated short queries and evaluated subjectively the top 10 results using a graded relevance scale of 0-3. Users were not informed about the OCR quality differences of the otherwise identical articles.FindingsThe main result of the study is that improved OCR quality affects subjective user perception of historical newspaper articles positively: higher relevance scores are given to better-quality texts.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this simulated interactive work task experiment is the first one showing empirically that users' subjective relevance assessments are affected by a change in the quality of an optically read text.","2023-05-23","2023-09-01 16:51:41","2023-09-01 16:52:04","","137-156","","7","79","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000998322900001","","","","","","","Evaluation; Finnish; HEMDIG - WOS; Historical newspapers; INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; Interactive information retrieval; OCR quality; PAPER; Simulated work task","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Setting up a Low Resource OCR Post-correction Framework for a Digitized Old Finnish Newspaper Collection","","1865-0929","","10.1007/978-3-319-41938-1_11","","There has been a huge interest in digitization of both hand-written and printed historical material in the last 10-15 years and most probably this interest will only increase in the ongoing Digital Humanities era. As a result of the interest we have lots of digital historical document collections available and will have more of them in the future. The National Library of Finland has digitized a large proportion of the historical newspapers published in Finland between 1771 and 1910 [1-3]; the collection, Digi, can be reached at http://digi.kansalliskirjasto.fi/. This collection contains approximately 1.95 million pages in Finnish and Swedish, the Finnish part being about 2.385 billion words. In the output of the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process, errors are common especially when the texts are printed in the Gothic (Fraktur, blackletter) typeface. The errors lower the usability of the corpus both from the point of view of human users as well as considering possible elaborated text mining applications. Automatic spell checking and correction of the data is also difficult due to the historical spelling variants and low OCR quality level of the material. This paper discusses the overall situation of the intended post-correction of the Digi content and evaluation of the correction. We shall present results of our post-correction trials, and discuss some aspects of methodology of evaluation. These are the first reported evaluation results of post-correction of the data and the experiences will be used in planning of the post-correction of the whole material.","2016","2023-09-01 16:51:41","2023-09-01 16:52:04","","95-103","","","612","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000389719300011","","","","","","","Evaluation; HEMDIG - WOS; Historical newspaper collections; OCR post-correction; TEXT","","Calvanese, D; DeNart, D; Tasso, C","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DIGITAL LIBRARIES ON THE MOVE, IRCDL 2015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a new search engine for historical documents, DuoSearch, which uses ElasticSearch and machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to offer a solution to this problem. It was tested on a collection of historical newspapers in Bulgarian from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century. The system provides an interactive and intuitive interface for the end-users allowing them to enter search terms in modern Bulgarian and search across historical spellings. This is the first solution facilitating the use of digitised historical documents in Bulgarian.","2022","2023-09-01 16:51:41","2023-09-01 16:52:04","","265-269","","","13186","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000787788000031","","","","","","","BERT; HEMDIG - WOS; Historical newspapers search engine; Orthographic variety; Post-OCR text correction","","Hagen, M; Verberne, S; Macdonald, C; Seifert, C; Balog, K; Norvag, K; Setty, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ADVANCES IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, PT II","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such information concerning Australian history can be gleaned from Trove's digitized collection of historical newspapers (1803-1954). This research aims to mine Trove's articles using closed and maximal association rules mining along with visualization tools to discover, conceptualize and understand the type, size and complexity of the notable relationships that existed between persons in historical Australia. Before the articles could be mined, they needed vigorous cleaning. Given the data's source, type and extraction methods, estimated word-error rates were at 50-75 %. Pre-processing efforts were aimed at reducing errors originating from optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing and some co-referencing both within and between articles. Only after cleaning were the datasets able to return interesting associations at higher support thresholds.","2015","2023-09-01 16:51:41","2023-09-01 16:52:04","","572-588","","","9457","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000367683000051","","","","","","","Association rule mining; HEMDIG - WOS; Natural language processing; OCR errors","","Pfahringer, B; Renz, J","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AI 2015: ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evaluation results reported in the paper are based mainly on a 500 000 word sample of the Finnish language part of the whole collection. The sample has three different parallel parts: a manually corrected ground truth version, original OCR with ABBYY FineReader v. 7 or v. 8, and an ABBYY FineReader v. 11 re-OCRed version for comparison with Tesseract's OCR. Using this sample and its page image originals we have developed a re-OCRing procedure using the open source software package Tesseract v. 3.04.01. Our method achieved initially 27.48% improvement vs. ABBYY FineReader 7 or 8 and 9.16% improvement vs. ABBYY FineReader 11 on document level. On word level our method achieved 36.25% improvement vs. ABBYY FineReader 7 or 8 and 20.14% improvement vs. ABBYY FineReader 11. Our final precision and recall results on word level show clear improvement in the quality: recall is 76.0 and precision 92.0 in comparison to GT OCR. Other measures, such as recognizability of words with a morphological analyzer and character accuracy rate, show also steady improvement after re-OCRing.","2020","2023-09-01 16:51:42","2023-09-01 16:52:04","","17-30","","","12598","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000886643200002","","","","","","","Evaluation; Finnish; HEMDIG - WOS; Historical newspaper collections; Optical character recognition; POST-CORRECTION; RETRIEVAL","","Vetulani, Z; Paroubek, P; Kubis, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","HUMAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY.
