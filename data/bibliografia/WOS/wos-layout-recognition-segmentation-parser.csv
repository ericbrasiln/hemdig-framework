In this, a wide variety of legal, logistical, technical and other challenges were encountered. After introducing the background issues in newspaper digitization in Europe, the paper discusses the technical aspects of refinement in greater detail.

However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, we propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, we introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. Our recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. © 1995 IEEE","1995","2022-11-04 11:54:31","2023-09-01 16:59:20","","432-445","","4","17","","IEEE Trans.

Thus, currently used documents may be categorized roughly on the basis of the geometrical layout structure and logical structure. Table-form documents are strictly defined by the geometrical layout structure in comparison with the other documents. Since the item fields are, in general, surrounded with vertical and horizontal line segments, with a view to understanding table-form documents it is better to recognize these line segments first and then identify individual item fields on the basis of the recognition results. At least, in table-form documents the vertical and horizontal line segments take important roles in recognizing the layout structures. In this article, we address a multilayer recognition method for understanding table-form documents. Our recognition layers are composed hierarchically of four different recognition processes: document class recognition, layout recognition, item recognition, and character recognition. In addition, our recognition method is organized on the basis of the interaction paradigm that the lower-layer recognition process verifies objects interpreted in the upper-layer recognition process with its own knowledge and then decomposes the objects into more elementary and meaningful objects. Moreover, we discuss a knowledge representation method from the viewpoints of physical and logical representations, and syntactic and semantic information. We also show the knowledge that is useful in understanding table-form documents with respect to such a representation method. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, inc.","1996","2022-11-04 11:54:27","2023-09-01 16:59:15","","279-288","","4","7","","Int J Imaging Syst Technol","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Inc.","","","","Character recognition; Data processing; Document class recognition; HEMDIG - SCOPUS; HEMDIG - WOS; Image understanding; Item recognition; Layout recognition; Multilayer recognition methods; Object recognition; Pattern recognition systems; SCOPUS; Table form documents","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recognition latency was a linear function of the angular distance between a test view and the study view. In Experiment 2, participants studied a layout from a single view and then learned to recognize the layout from three additional training views. A final recognition test showed that the study view and the training views were represented in memory, and that latency was a linear function of the angular distance to the nearest study or training view. These results indicate that interobject spatial relations are encoded in a viewpoint-dependent manner, and that recognition of novel views requires normalization to the most similar representation in memory. These findings parallel recent results in visual object recognition.","1997","2022-11-04 11:54:25","2023-09-01 16:59:14","","302-307","","4","8","","Psychol.

Then, the processing mechanisms are assessed with a view to establishing the criteria for selecting the knowledge representation means appropriate to the document types. First, we define the physical layout structure and logical layout structure in addition to the traditional concepts of layout structure and logical structure. Second, we define the document type on the basis of the relationship between the physical layout structure and logical layout structure. Third, we make the knowledge representation means and the processing mechanisms clear under the document types.

The first stage, preprocessing, extracts statistical information that may be used for background detection and removal. The second stage, a tree based classifier, uses a variable block size and a set of probabilistic rules to classify segmented blocks. When a block cannot be classified at a given block size because contains more than one class, it is split in four sub-blocks that are independently classified. The third stage, postprocessing, uses the label map generated in the second stage with a set of context rules to label unclassified blocks, trying also to solve some of the misclassification errors that may have been generated during the previous stage. The progressive scheme used in the second and third stages allows the user to stop the classification process at any block size, depending on his requirements. Experiments show that a progressive scheme combined with a set of postprocessing rules increases the percentage of correctly classified blocks and reduces the number of block computations.","1999","2022-11-04 11:54:21","2023-09-01 16:59:12","1999-07-21","241-251","","","3816","","","","","","","","Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers","Bellingham, WA, United States","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","","","","COMPRESSION; document analysis; Document analysis; Document layout recognition; HEMDIG - SCOPUS; HEMDIG - WOS; Image coding; Image compression; Image quality; Information analysis; Information retrieval systems; Pattern recognition systems; Probability; Progressive classification tree; progressive classification trees; SCOPUS; wavelet packets; Wavelet packets","","","","","SPIE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of the 1999 Mathematical Modeling, Bayesian Estimation, and Inverse Problems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is noted that the principal origin of mail rejection is related to the failure of address-block localization task, particularly, of the physical layout segmentation stage. The bottom-up and top-down segmentation methods bring different knowledge that should not be ignored when we need to increase the robustness. Hybrid methods combine the two strategies in order to take advantages of one strategy to the detriment of other.

The purpose of this study is to develop a simple model that can predict mask write time precisely, without an e-beam writer. With a good understanding of the trade-offs between design complexity and write time, mask makers can work with mask designers more closely to simplify design and minimize mask cost. This work compared several basic models including calculations based on write area with a fixed e-beam shot size, a software estimation with a pre-set exposure, and a mask stage settling time. Our proposed model uses a completely different approach to examine the correlation between layout complexity (vertices count, total line edge, figure, etc.) through a CATS layout segmentation and actual write time. It is found that write time is a strong function of layout figure, vertex count and total line edge. Errors between actual write time and estimated write time from the new model reduced from 7% on average on the current production software to 3%. Additionally, the new model can operate independent of the writer type and without fractured data being transferred onto a writer. Also provided are a few case studies to evaluate the interaction between write time and basic shape/OPC (optical proximity correction). Using a simple design shape and a better data snapping strategy can reduce write time up to 10 fold for applications in nano-imprint template manufacturing. Several strategies to reduce mask cost are proposed.","2005","2022-11-04 11:54:12","2023-09-01 16:58:48","2005-03-03","313-318","","","5756","","","","","","","","","San Jose, CA","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","","","","CATS; Cost benefit analysis; Data acquisition; design optimization; Design optimization; HEMDIG - SCOPUS; HEMDIG - WOS; Image segmentation; mask write time; Mask write time; OPC; Optical correlation; Optical design; Optical engineering; Optical systems; SCOPUS; vertex; Vertex","","Liebmann L.W.","","","SPIE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Design and Process Integration for Microelectronic Manufacturing III","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, in order to control the quality of historical document image digitization and to meet the need of a characterization of their content using intermediate level metadata (between image and document structure), we propose a fast automatic layout segmentation of old document images based on five descriptors. Those descriptors, based on the autocorrelation function, are obtained by multiresolution analysis and used afterwards in a specific clustering method. The method proposed in this article has the advantage that it is performed without any hypothesis on the document structure, either about the document model (physical structure), or the typographical parameters (logical structure). It is also parameter-free since it automatically adapts to the image content. In this paper, firstly, we detail our proposal to characterize the content of old documents by extracting the autocorrelation features in the different areas of a page and at several resolutions. Then, we show that is possible to automatically find the homogeneous regions defined by similar indices of autocorrelation without knowledge about the number of clusters using adapted hierarchical ascendant classification and consensus clustering approaches. To assess our method, we apply our algorithm on 316 old document images, which encompass six centuries (1200-1900) of French history, in order to demonstrate the performance of our proposal in terms of segmentation and characterization of heterogeneous corpus content. Moreover, we define a new evaluation metric, the homogeneity measure, which aims at evaluating the segmentation and characterization accuracy of our methodology. We find a 85% of mean homogeneity accuracy. Those results help to represent a document by a hierarchy of layout structure and content, and to define one or more signatures for each page, on the basis of a hierarchical representation of homogeneous blocks and their topology. © 2013 SPIE-IS&T.","2013","2022-11-04 11:53:50","2023-09-01 16:58:18","2013-02-05","","","","8658","","","","","","","","","Burlingame, CA","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","","","","autocorrelation; Autocorrelation; Autocorrelation features; Autocorrelation functions; Characterization; Cluster analysis; consensus clustering; Consensus clustering; consensus clustering.; Digital image storage; Digital libraries; directional rose; Directional rose; Document layout analysis; HEMDIG - SCOPUS; HEMDIG - WOS; Heterogeneous collections; Hierarchical representation; Image segmentation; Metadata; Multi-resolutions; multiresolution; Multiresolution analysis; Optical character recognition; Quality control; Regression analysis; SCOPUS; Segmentation","","","","","The Society for Imaging Science and Technology (IS and T); The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE); Qualcomm Inc.; Google Inc.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Document Recognition and Retrieval XX","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This layout recognition is achieved by a cascade of two Dynamic Multilayer Perceptron (DMLP) classifiers and works without binarisation. In the second step, an algorithm takes the layout recognition results as an input, extracts the text lines, and groups them into blocks using the connected components approach.

In this article, we propose to search the homogeneous regions from the content of historical digitized books with little a priori knowledge by extracting and analyzing texture features. The novelty of this work lies in the unsupervised clustering of the extracted texture descriptors to find homogeneous regions, i.e. graphic and textual regions, by performing the clustering approach on an entire book instead of processing each page individually. We propose firstly to characterize the content of an entire book by extracting the texture information of each page, as our goal is to compare and index the content of digitized books. The extraction of texture features, computed without any hypothesis on the document structure, is based on two non-parametric tools: the autocorrelation function and multiresolution analysis. Secondly, we perform an unsupervised clustering approach on the extracted features in order to classify automatically the homogeneous regions of book pages. The clustering results are assessed by internal and external accuracy measures. The overall results are quite satisfying. Such analysis would help to construct a computer-aided categorization tool of pages. © 2013 IEEE.","2013","2022-11-04 11:53:46","2023-09-01 16:58:16","2013-08-25","817-821","","","","","","","","","","","","Washington, DC","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Traditionally, the 3D layout is derived by solving a pixel-level classification problem. However, the image-level 3D structure can be very beneficial for extracting pixel-level 3D layout since it implies the way how pixels in the image are organized. In this paper, we propose an approach that first predicts the global image structure, and then we use the global structure for fine-grained pixel-level 3D layout extraction. In particular, image features are extracted based on multiple layout templates. We then learn a discriminative model for classifying the global layout at the image-level. Using latent variables, we implicitly model the sublevel semantics of the image, which enrich the expressiveness of our model. After the image-level structure is obtained, it is used as the prior knowledge to infer pixel-wise 3D layout. Experiments show that the results of our model outperform the state-of-the-art methods by 11.7% for 3D structure classification. Moreover, we show that employing the 3D structure prior information yields accurate 3D scene layout segmentation. © 1992-2012 IEEE.","2015","2022-11-04 11:53:41","2023-09-01 16:57:57","","3098-3108","","10","24","","IEEE Trans Image Process","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","3D layout; 3D layouts; Discriminative models; GRADIENTS; HEMDIG - SCOPUS; HEMDIG - WOS; Image analysis; Image processing; Image Structures; Object localization; Pixels; Prior information; SCENE; SCOPUS; Semantics; Stage classification; State-of-the-art methods; structural SVM; Structural SVM; Three dimensional computer graphics; Video categorization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, as the lexicon grows, the computation time increases. In this paper, we present the Arabic word descriptor (AWD) for Arabic word shape indexing and lexicon reduction in handwritten documents. It is formed in two stages. First, the structural descriptor (SD) is computed for each connected component (CC) of the word image. It describes the CC shape using the bag-of-words model, where each visual word represents a different local shape structure, extracted from the image with filters of different patterns and scales. Then, the AWD is formed by sorting and normalizing the SDs. This emphasizes the symbolic features of Arabic words, such as subwords and diacritics, without performing layout segmentation. In the context of lexicon reduction, the AWD is used to index a reference database. Given a query image, the reduced lexicon is obtained from the labels of the first entries in the indexed database. This framework has been tested on Arabic word databases. It has a low computational overhead, while providing a compact descriptor, with state-of-the-art results for lexicon reduction on the Ibn Sina and IFN/ENIT databases. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2014","2022-11-04 11:53:45","2023-09-01 16:58:06","","3477-3486","","10","47","","Pattern Recogn.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","Arabic handwritten documents; Arabic word descriptor; Database systems; Descriptors; HEMDIG - SCOPUS; HEMDIG - WOS; Holistic representation; Ibn Sina database; IFN/ENIT; Indexing (of information); Information retrieval; Lexicon reduction; Lexicon reductions; Query processing; RECOGNITION; SCOPUS; Shape indexing; Vocabulary control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Road layout parsing is fundamentally important to this, and has attracted deserved attention on the urban road net where traffic signs are well established. However, for the unmarked traffic scenes, like campus and residence community, the large variation on individual surroundings leads to a reduced attention on public research and a lack of both available dataset and generic methods. To explore this issue, we present a novel automatic annotation method to analyze road semantics, which regards the prior trajectories of a vehicle as multi-dimensional space series and extends the traditional time series methods to the space domain to process the data. In order to achieve this, we first propose Incremental Dynamic Space Warping (IDSW) to synchronize space series and extract statistical road feature, then a Bayesian nonparametric method based on the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) is introduced to generate road semantic sections without explicitly specifying the number of class. Experiment results demonstrate the proposed method can produce road semantics in different level and annotate not only the physical road position but also the vision observations: based on the extracted road modes, the method can annotate corresponding vision image with a positive class label and a rough distance to the road intersection. © 2018 IEEE.","2018","2022-11-04 11:53:30","2023-09-01 16:57:27","2018-12-12","1177-1182","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

We propose a room layout segmentation and adjacent room detection algorithm to represent layouts as an undirected graph. We have also proposed a novel graph spectral embedding feature to uniquely represent the layout of the architectural floorplan. This helps in effective and efficient matching of the room layouts. Room semantics in terms of both the room structures and room decor is used to retrieve similar floorplans from the repository.

Document object categories often share primitives from a low-level perspective (e.g. regions inside bars in a bar chart resemble background), making it difficult to evaluate document layout segmentation methods based on pixel classification, as most datasets and ground truth models focus on document objects. We propose a novel ground truth model that utilizes structural and statistical pattern recognition concepts. Statistical pixel-based data derived from low-level elemental patterns are layered onto high-level structural object-based data. We also present evaluation metrics that take advantage of the layered ground truth model, allowing a contextual evaluation of pixel classification algorithms. We apply the proposed model to two recent pixel classification approaches, evaluated on business document images that exhibit a challenging mixture of textual, graphical, and pictorial elements through varied layouts. The proposed model allows to obtain very detailed, comprehensive, and intuitive information on the strengths and limitations of the evaluated approaches that would be impossible to obtain through other models. © 2016 IEEE.","2016","2022-11-04 11:53:36","2023-09-01 16:57:51","2016-12-04","3258-3263","","","0","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

In this paper, we propose an effective approach for security issue of handwriting documents in spatial domain by making use of watermarking technique. To begin with, the handwritten document is pre-processed by replacing gray level values holding high intensity with the mean value of document content. The document is then transformed into standard form to minimize geometric distortion. Next, fully convolutional networks (FCN) is leveraged to detect document's watermarking regions used for hiding secret information wherein an approach of FCN for document layout segmentation is adjusted to solve the problem of watermarking region detection. Lastly, the data hiding process is conducted by dividing gray level values of each connected object situated within watermarking regions into two sets for carrying one watermark bit. The experiments are performed on various handwritten documents, and our approach achieves high performance regarding such properties as imperceptibility and robustness against distortions caused by JPEG compression, geometric transformation and print-and-scan process. © 2018 IEEE.","2018","2022-11-04 11:53:29","2023-09-01 16:57:30","2018-08-05","303-308","","","2018-August","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

The untrusted foundry has front-end-of-line (FEOL) layout and the original circuit netlist and attempts to identify critical components on the layout for Trojan insertion. Although defense methods for this scenario have been developed, the corresponding attack technique is not well explored. For instance, Boolean satisfiability (SAT) based bijective mapping attack is mentioned without detailed research. Hence, the defense methods are mostly evaluated with the k-security metric without actual attacks. We provide the first systematic study, to the best of our knowledge, on attack techniques in this scenario. Besides of implementing SAT-based bijective mapping attack, we develop a new attack technique based on structural pattern matching. Experimental comparison with bijective mapping attack shows that the new attack technique achieves about the same success rate with much faster speed for cases without the k-security defense, and has a much better success rate at the same runtime for cases with k-security defense.

However, pattern synthesis is challenging because it is difficult to understand and generate complex structures in patterns. In this paper, we propose an approach based on the layout tree descriptor (LTD) to understand and synthesize patterns from existing ones. The LTD is a binary tree that parametrically describes all primitives, layouts, their dependencies and hierarchies in a pattern. The LTD can be constructed automatically with proposed instance grouping, layout recognition, hyper-primitive matching and tree merging algorithms to realize pattern understanding. To meet specialists’ requirements for detailed modification and recombination of patterns, we designed LTD operations including add, remove, replace and grafting operations to allow users to get new patterns by simply adjusting the LTDs. For stylized synthesis, we gave the computing method of LTD similarity. Therefore, the styles of results and input can be compared and users can control generated serialized results by setting the input pattern weights. To meet user’s implicit preferences and provide novelty in creative design, we propose an evolutionary approach to creative synthesis. The system generates new patterns continuously based on LTD grafting, meanwhile user selection of preferred patterns will guide the direction of evolution. Experiments using the developed prototype system show that our approach can synthesize novel and complex patterns effectively, meeting different requirements in practice and providing plenty of digital textures for products. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2020","2022-11-04 11:53:13","2023-09-01 16:55:47","","1141-1155","","6","36","","Visual Comput","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer","","","","Binary trees; DESIGN; Design space exploration; Design tool; Design tools; GraphicaL model; Graphical models; HEMDIG - SCOPUS; HEMDIG - WOS; Layouts; Patterns; RELATIVE POSITIONS; REPRESENTATION; SCOPUS; Synthesis; Synthesis (chemical); SYSTEM; TEXTILE; Textures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It would be significant to construct an intelligent CAD system allowing automatic architectural layout parsing (AutoALP), which generates candidate designs or predicts architectural attributes without much user intervention. To tackle these problems, many learning-based methods were proposed, and benchmark dataset become one of the essential elements for the data-driven AutoALP. This paper proposes a new dataset called SCUT-AutoALP for multi-paradigm applications. It contains two subsets: 1) Subset-I is for floor plan design containing 300 residential floor plan images with layout, boundary and attribute labels; 2) Subset-II is for urban plan design containing 302 campus plan images with layout, boundary and attribute labels. We analyzed the samples and labels statistically, and evaluated SCUT-AutoALP for different layout parsing tasks of floor plan/urban plan based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) models.

Specifically, the task of room layout estimation is to segment an indoor RGB image with semantic surface labels, i.e., ceiling, floor, and walls. A straightforward solution for the problem is to estimate the geometry of the dominant indoor planes. However, since the ground truth depth maps of the layout is not easy to obtain, research in this direction is rare. In this paper, we focus on the cuboid rooms and propose an effective learning framework that can learn the depth maps of planes from 2D layout labels without ground truth depth maps. We employ a deep network to learn the surface parameters, which can be used to produce depth maps of planes and layout results. Then we propose stereo supervision mechanism that encourages the generated layout to be consistent with the ground truth layout segmentation along Z axis and layout edge on the image plane simultaneously, so that the learned surface parameters and layout results are reasonable. Experimental results show that our method can produce high-quality layout estimates and corresponding depth maps on benchmark datasets. © 2021 IEEE.","2021","2022-11-04 11:52:56","2023-09-01 16:54:50","2021-11-26","777-782","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

Our approach elevates the understanding of road layouts from pixel level to the level of graphs. To achieve this goal, an image-graph-image auto-encoder is utilized. The network is designed to learn to regress the graph representation at its auto-encoder bottleneck. This learning is self-supervised by an image reconstruction loss, without needing any external manual annotations. We create a synthetic dataset containing common road layout patterns and use it for training of the auto-encoder in addition to the real-world Argoverse dataset. By using this additional synthetic dataset, which conceptually captures human knowledge of road layouts and makes this available to the network for training, we are able to stabilize and further improve the performance of topological road layout understanding on the real-world Argoverse dataset.

The information in documents is typically in natural language, but can be organized in various layouts and formats. There have been recent spurt of interest in understanding document content with novel deep learning architectures. However, document understanding tasks need dense information annotations, which are costly to scale and generalize. Several active learning techniques have been proposed to reduce the overall budget of annotation while maintaining the performance of the underlying deep learning model. In this paper, we propose OPAD, a novel framework using reinforcement policy for active learning in content detection tasks for documents. The proposed framework learns the acquisition function to decide the samples to be selected while optimizing performance metrics that the tasks typically have. Furthermore, we extend to weak labelling scenarios to further reduce the cost of annotation significantly. We propose novel rewards to account for class imbalance and user feedback in the annotation interface, to improve the active learning method. We show superior performance of the proposed OPAD framework for active learning for various tasks related to document understanding like layout parsing, object detection and named entity recognition. Ablation studies for human feedback and class imbalance rewards are presented, along with a comparison of annotation times for different approaches. © 2022 IEEE.","2022","2022-11-04 11:52:44","2023-09-01 16:54:29","2022-06-19","2825-2835","","","2022-June","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","WOS:000861612702113","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Comput.

We describe here a synthetic document generator that automatically produces realistic documents with labels for spatial positions, extents and categories of the layout elements. The proposed generative process treats every physical component of a document as a random variable and models their intrinsic dependencies using a Bayesian Network graph. Our hierarchical formulation using stochastic templates allow parameter sharing between documents for retaining broad themes and yet the distributional characteristics produces visually unique samples, thereby capturing complex and diverse layouts.

In this paper, we present a novel weakly supervised learning framework that is able to learn the 3D layout effectively with 2D layout segmentation mask as supervision. We employ a deep neural network to predict the plane parameters and camera intrinsic parameters in the image. Based on the predicted plane instances, the 3D layout as well as the corresponding depth map and 2D segmentation can be generated. The key objectives for learning meaningful plane parameters are the label consistency of layout segmentation and depth consistency of border pixels from adjacent planes, with which the ground truth 2D layout segmentation is able to supervise the learning of the 3D layout.

In order to explore a suitable method for layout segmentation and description of Tibetan document images, a research method based on the adaptive run length smoothing algorithm is proposed. Firstly, according to the layout structure of Tibetan document images, K-means clustering analysis is used to get the run length threshold suitable for the layout, smooth the run length, find the connected component, and realize the layout segmentation. Then, according to the external contour characteristics of each layout element, the text area and nontext area are simply distinguished. Finally, the text area is recognized by a Tibetan text recognizer, and then the extensible markup language is used to record layout information and realize layout description. Experiments on Tibetan primary and secondary school teaching materials and stereotyped Tibetan document images show that this method can achieve good layout analysis results.","2021-07","2023-09-01 16:49:25","2023-09-01 16:50:54","","","","14","58","","","","","","","","","","Chinese","","","","WOS:000686494700015","","","","","","","adaptive run length smoothing; HEMDIG - WOS; image processing; layout description; layout segmentation; Tibetan document image","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Document Layout segmentation, which aims at identifying the different structural components of a document page, is a particularly interesting task connected to this trend, specifically when it comes to handwritten texts. While there are many effective approaches to this problem, they all rely on large amounts of data for the training of the underlying models, which is rarely possible in a real-world scenario, as the process of producing the ground truth segmentation task with the required precision to the pixel level is a very time-consuming task and often requires a certain degree of domain knowledge regarding the documents at hand. For this reason, in this paper, we propose an effective few-shot learning framework for document layout segmentation relying on two novel components, namely a dynamic instance generation and a segmentation refinement module. This approach is able of achieving performances comparable to the current state of the art on the popular Diva-HisDB dataset, while relying on just a fraction of the available data.","2023-08-10","2023-09-01 16:49:25","2023-09-01 16:50:54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:001047104800001","","","","","","","Document layout segmentation; few-shot learning; handwritten documents analysis; HEMDIG - WOS; image segmentation; layout analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aim to address issues concerning dynamic multimedia signage where the content are divided into several sections. This type of signage has become increasingly popular due to optimal content exposures. In contrast to prior research, our approach excludes computer vision based object recognition, and instead took an approach to identify how contents are being laid-out in a digital signage. We incorporate techniques to recognize basic layout features including corners, lines, edges, and line segments; which are obtained from the camera frame taken by the user using their own device. Consequently, these layout features are combined to generate signage layout map, which is then compared to pre-learned layout map for position detection and perspective correction using homography estimation. To grab a specific content, users are able to choose a section within the captured layout using the device's interface, which in turn creates a request to contents server to send respective content information based on a timestamp and a unique section ID.

However, the accessibility of STEM subjects for Blind and Visually Impaired (BVIP) students is a primary concern, especially in developing countries such as India. BVIP uses assistive technologies (ATs) like optical character recognition (OCR) and screen readers for reading/writing purposes. While parsing, such ATs skip NTCs and mainly rely on alternative texts to describe these visualization components. Integration of effective and automated document layout parsing frameworks for extracting data from non-textual components of digital documents are required with existing ATs for making these NTCs accessible. Although, the primary concern is the absence of an adequately annotated textbook dataset on which layout recognition and other vision-based frameworks can be trained. To improve the accessibility and automated parsing of such books, we introduce a new NCERT5K-IITRPR dataset of National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) school books. Twenty-three annotated books covering more than 5000 pages from the eighth to twelve standards have been considered. The NCERT label objects are structurally different from the existing document layout analysis (DLA) dataset objects and contain diverse label categories. We benchmark the NCERT5K-IITRPR dataset with multiple object detection methods. A systematic analysis of detectors shows the label complexity and fine-tuning necessity of the NCERT5K-IITRPR dataset. We hope that our dataset helps in improving the accessibility of NCERT Books for BVIP students.","2022","2023-09-01 16:49:25","2023-09-01 16:50:54","","461-475","","","13237","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000870314500031","","","","","","","Assistive reading; Document layout analysis; Graphical object detection; HEMDIG - WOS; NCERT books; NCERT dataset","","Uchida, S; Barney, E; Eglin, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOCUMENT ANALYSIS SYSTEMS, DAS 2022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While useful, the aggregation is a trade-off between instance-level analysis of predictions which may shed better light on a particular approach's biases and performance characteristics. To enable a systematic understanding of instance-level predictions, we introduce DocVisor - a web-based multi-purpose visualization tool for analyzing the data and predictions related to various document image understanding problems. DocVisor provides support for visualizing data sorted using custom-specified performance metrics and display styles. It also supports the visualization of intermediate outputs (e.g., attention maps, coarse predictions) of the processing pipelines. This paper describes the appealing features of DocVisor and showcases its multi-purpose nature and general utility. We illustrate DocVisor's functionality for four popular document understanding tasks - document region layout segmentation, tabular data detection, weakly-supervised document region segmentation and optical character recognition.

This paper proposes a novel two-branch neural networks model to estimate 3D layouts of cuboid and non-cuboid room types. The model embeds the ordinal relation between layout planes into the layout segmentation branch through an proposed ordinal classification loss function, and outputs both pixel-level layout segmentation maps and layout plane parameter maps. Then, the instance-level plane parameters of each layout plane are determined by using an instance-aware pooling layer. Finally, the sharpness of layout edges of the 2D layout semantic segmentation map is optimized by using an improved depth map intersection algorithm.

It is the vital step to support high-quality information extraction, table understanding and knowledge base construction over the documents from various vertical domains (e.g. financial, legal, and government fields). Here, we consider digital documents, where characters and graphic elements are given with their exact texts, positions inside document pages, compared with image documents. Towards document layout recognition with pinpoint accuracy, we consider this problem as a document panoptic segmentation task, that each token in the document page must be assigned a class label and an instance id. Considering that two predicted objects may intersect under traditional visual panoptic segmentation method, like Mask R-CNN, however, document objects never intersect because most document pages follow manhattan layout. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, named document panoptic segmentation (DPS) model. It first splits the document page into column regions and groups tokens into line regions, then extracts the textual and visual features, and finally assigns class label and instance id to each line region. Additionally, we propose a novel metric based on the intersection over union (IoU) between the tokens contained in predicted and the ground-truth object, which is more suitable than metric based on the area IoU between predicted and the ground-truth bounding box. Finally, the empirical experiments based on PubLayNet, ArXiv and Financial datasets show that the proposed DPS model obtains 0.8833, 0.9205 and 0.8530 mAP scores on three datasets. The proposed model obtains great improvement on mAP score compared with Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN models.","2021","2023-09-01 16:49:26","2023-09-01 16:50:54","","3-18","","","12822","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","WOS:000770800600001","","","","","","","HEMDIG - WOS","","Llados, J; Lopresti, D; Uchida, S","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION - ICDAR 2021, PT II","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advances in natural language processing have been driving the fast development in automated information extraction from scientific literature. However, scientific literature is often available in unstructured PDF format. While PDF is great for preserving basic visual elements, such as characters, lines, shapes, etc., on a canvas for presentation to humans, automatic processing of the PDF format by machines presents many challenges. With over 2.5 trillion PDF documents in existence, these issues are prevalent in many other important application domains as well. A critical challenge for automated information extraction from scientific literature is that documents often contain content that is not in natural language, such as figures and tables. Nevertheless, such content usually illustrates key results, messages, or summarizations of the research. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of scientific literature, the automated system must be able to recognize the layout of the documents and parse the non-natural-language content into a machine readable format. Our ICDAR 2021 Scientific Literature Parsing Competition (ICDAR2021-SLP) aims to drive the advances specifically in document understanding. ICDAR2021-SLP leverages the PubLayNet and PubTab-Net datasets, which provide hundreds of thousands of training and evaluation examples. In Task A, Document Layout Recognition, submissions with the highest performance combine object detection and specialised solutions for the different categories. In Task B, Table Recognition, top submissions rely on methods to identify table components and post-processing methods to generate the table structure and content.
